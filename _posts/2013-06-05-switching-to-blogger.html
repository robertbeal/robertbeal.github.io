<p>I've finally decided to leave my self-hosted Wordpress and move to Blogger. While I like Wordpress, it is a little bloated for my needs and has hosting costs. I'm also responsible for monitoring and maintaining it. Hence I've decided to move to Blogger to easy those responsibilities. While Blogger isn't as flexible as Wordpress, it does all I need and it's pretty quick!</p>
