<p>
  I've been using rake for a few years now to do builds and deployments. It
  first started off at <a href="http://huddle.com" target="_blank">Huddle</a>,
  as a way of escaping NAnt due to it's xml nastiness and lack of power. Being
  honest, it was a naive step into Ruby and the outcome was a poorly written, C#
  styled set of scripts that were untested. From that point I've learnt a number
  of lessons...

<h3>Best Practise</h3>
<p>
  If you're new to Ruby, first things first, find out how write and use the
  language as per it's typical standards. This goes from naming classes, to
  methods, to requiring other classes. I've decided not to include any links as
  this should be an exploratory phase. Read a book, go on Google and start
  searching for terms such as "Ruby best practise" etc..., find some well-known,
  mature Ruby projects in Github and have a browse around the code. There are
  plenty of places to find where Ruby is written correctly.
</p>
<strong>You're doing something wrong if:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    You find you're self doing more than a simple "require 'myclass'" and have
    __FILE__ expands etc... for referencing other classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your scripts are littered with GLOBAL_CONSTANTS that are being used by child
    "required" Ruby files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your classes aren't as clean as they would be in another language. Say for
    example, you have come from C#. An equivalent Ruby class should look just as
    clean, if not a little cleaner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your rakefile is not easy to read, and see what tasks it can perform, ie
    tasks are created and hidden in the depths of your code
  </li>
  <li>Your putting complex logic in without any tests around it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
<p>
  I've written my own build framework,
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/rakeoff" target="_blank">rakeoff</a
  >, but generally speaking it's not typically required as it will add
  complexity and logic behind the scenes that others won't know about. Your
  scripts should be fairly simple as building, testing and deploying often
  aren't complicated steps.
</p>
<p>
  Where possible, do the simplest thing possible, ie just get rake to execute a
  command line. If the command line fails, you'll see what and why in the build
  logs. You don't need anything more clever than that. By keeping it closer to
  command lines means it's easier to understand and replay locally.

  pre.CICodeFormatter {
    font-family: arial;
    font-size: 12px;
    border: 1px dashed #cccccc;
    width: 99%;
    height: auto;
    overflow: auto;
    background: #f0f0f0;

    text-align: left;
  }
  pre.CICodeFormatter code {
    color: #000000;
    word-wrap: normal;
  }
</style>
<pre
  class="CICodeFormatter"
><code class="CICodeFormatter"> task :msbuild do  <br />    sh '%windir%/microsoft.net/framework/v3.5/msbuild.exe /t:Clean;Build /p:Configuration=Release /m /consoleloggerparameters:ErrorsOnly MySolution.sln'  <br /> end  <br /></code></pre>
<h3>Gems & Bundler</h3>
<p>
  Using gems (and Bundler) should be pretty standard. Not only for external
  libraries, but internal ones. Don't go writing a bunch of scripts that are
  shared across applications, because when you update them you risk breaking all
  of your apps. Allow apps to determine what version of your scripts they want
  to run via a Gemfile.
</p>
<p>
  Also it's far nicer to build a gem, then simply have a "require 'blah'" in
  your code and it's working, rather than trying to include a Ruby file (via a
  submodule if it's shared).
</p>
<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>
  If you're not going to use "rake --tasks" for seeing what tasks are available
  (and from my experience not many people do that), then I would advise keeping
  all your tasks inside your main rakefile. Ie, don't have tasks hidden away in
  other scripts, keep them visible upfront in your rakefile.
</p>
<pre
  class="CICodeFormatter"
><code class="CICodeFormatter"> task :unit_tests do  <br />   run_tests('*.Unit.Tests')  <br /> end  <br /><br /> task :integration_tests, :environment do |t, args|  <br />   run_tests('*.Tests.Integration', args.environment)  <br /> end  <br /><br /> task :acceptance_tests, :environment do |t, args|  <br />   run_tests('*.Tests.Acceptance', args.environment)  <br /> end  <br /><br /> task :smoke_tests, :environment do |t, args|  <br />   run_tests('*.Tests.Smoke', args.environment)  <br /> end  <br /><br /> def run_tests(pattern, environment='local')  <br />   // Do some stuff  <br /> end  <br /></code></pre>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
  In cases where you're simply calling a command line, you shouldn't really need
  testing, assuming the command line will fail if mis-used (if it won't they you
  may need to consider tests). Your build environment will act as your tests and
  show you when something is broken. This should not affect live, as your
  internal environments should deploy in the same way, so you'll find out if
  something is broken internally first.
</p>
<p>
  If on occasion you do need to test some logic, then create a class that can be
  easily tested (as rake tasks can be a pain to test). Your rake task then just
  needs to call it (keep the task as thin as possible).
</p>
<pre
  class="CICodeFormatter"
><code class="CICodeFormatter"> task :unit_tests do  <br />   NUnit.new.run('*.Unit.Tests')  <br /> end  <br /></code></pre>
<h3>Artifacts</h3>
<p>
  One area you can easily break your build is around building up artifacts. If
  this dependency is put in your build environment (such as Team City), then it
  won't be testable. Often builds will fail if they can't find an artifact (say
  you want to deploy a build), but they may not if the artifacts exist, but are
  missing files, or aren't correct for whatever reason. Because of this I would
  either advise:
</p>
<p>
  a) keeping artifact configuration as simple as possible in your build
  environment. If you've got more than a few lines for including artifacts, then
  you should question if building the artifacts is more complex than it needs to
  be.
</p>
<p>
  b) building your artifacts in your Ruby scripts. That way you can, if needs
  be, test them and replicate it locally. Being able to replicate an artifact
  build locally is very useful when trying to fix an issue.
