  I previously made a number of modifications to my (now my brother's Croix De
  Fer) which I detailed in two articles (<a
    href="http://blog.robertbeal.com/2011/05/converting-genesis-croix-de-fer-into.html"
    >touring modifications</a
  >,
  <a href="http://blog.robertbeal.com/2012/01/further-genesis-croix-de-fer.html"
    >further modifications</a
  >). I've since made even more changes to the Croix De Fer but in doing so have
  perfected the set up and found some better suited components. Most notable
  changes to the mudguards, chainset and lots more leather!
</p>

<h3>Mudguards</h3>
<p>
  The SKS Chromoplastics 45mm have gone and been replaced with a set of Gilles
  Berthoud chrome fenders. I don't know the width, but at a guess they're
  40-42mm as they'll just squeeze a set of 32c tyres under them. Here are the
  benefits:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    They fit without the support needing to be bent around the disc calipers
  </li>
  <li>They're stronger and more rigid</li>
  <li>They weigh almost exactly the same as the SKS Chromoplastics</li>
  <li>They can be moulded / changed in shape if needed (explained below)</li>
  <li>They look far better!</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Croix De Fer has a relatively short chainstay making the mudguards a bit
  of a squeeze as they are very close to the front mech. Too close in fact. I
  had to knock the mudguard in just slightly so that it didn't interfere with
  the operation of the front mech. Not a problem as the mudguards are metal!

<p>
  They're no easier or harder to fit, just a pain and time consuming like
  fitting any mudguards. I fit them as standard on any of my or my friends bikes
  now, as at £30 they offer good value and look great.
</p>
<p>
  Fitting a mudflap is essential in keeping additional dirt and water from
  flicking on you. I opted for a Brooks leather one. It's holding up just fine
  despite some people having reservations about it being leather. It'll last
  many years to come and during all that time the bike looks better for it.
</p>
<h3>Chainset</h3>
<p>
  The Shimano Deore Hollowtech 2 chainset has gone. I never really liked the
  sporty look of it and have enjoyed going back to a square-taper bottom bracket
  as it allows me to choose the width of the bottom bracket and hence get the
  chainline spot on.
</p>
<p>
  A good value alternative is the Stronglight Impact with Shimano UN55 bottom
  bracket. I've opted for a 26/36/46T set of chainrings to give me plenty of
  range and a 118mm bottom bracket to achieve the circa 50mm chainline required
  for a Shimano MTB front mech.
</p>
<p>
  And yes, the chainset is "polished". I spent a weekend sanding the anodised
  finish off it, getting covered in black mess and finally polishing it.
</p>
<h3>Handlebars</h3>

<p>
  Gone are the 31.8mm handlebars as they look so ugly, and I'm not a heavy
  rider. Instead I've put a new stem with 26mm clamp and a set of Nitto Noodle
  M177's. They're fantastic handlebars, very comfortable and they look great.
</p>
<p>
  Add to that I've now wrapped them in leather instead of generic bar tape.
  Personally, I find leather has a far nicer grip and feel to it. Plus it'll
  last much longer and look better as it ages.
</p>
<p>
  And finally a bell! I can't believe I didn't have one before. Function over
  weight, and it actually looks quite good (an accessory). I bought a Lion bell,
  not cheap, but UK made (support local business in all) and top quality.
</p>
<h3>Shimergo</h3>
<p>
  I've switched to an 8-speed cassette rather than a 9-speed with the hubbub
  hack. It's just far smoother and less problematic. Also 11-30T cassettes are
  easy to find and very cheap at around £10. The 30T gives plenty of gear inches
  for getting up hills especially when combined with a 26T inner chainring.
</p>
<p>
  I also found an old/retro 8-speed XT rear mech. It looks better than the newer
  ones and has a barrel adjuster built in (something they've annoyingly removed
  from newer models). Found courtesy of eBay.
</p>
<p>
  So that concludes my changes to the Genesis Croix De Fer. There are a couple
  of other changes I'd like to make but they're largely aesthetic so can wait.
  a) a silver/polished seatpost, b) a silver/polished headset, c) some new
  handbuilt 36-spoke wheels, d) one day... either some BB7 brakes or the newer
  style of dual-sided mechanical disc brake (TRP Spyres).
