<p>I've recently been working on a build framework using Ruby. Having been a .Net "build master" of sorts for the past few years I've stumbled across many build configurations and problems. And as much as I like being a build master, I want to make my job as easy as possible. Enter conventions! We apply them everywhere else in development, why not in our build scripts. With this in mind I set about creating a set of intelligent, convention-based (but overrideable should you really wish) rake tasks. I chose Ruby because I find it flexible and quick for writing tasks, and well suited as a build language. The BDD frameworks available make testing the tasks easy.<br/><br/><a name='more'></a>The project is called <strong>RakeOff</strong>, and is hosted on Bit Bucket:<br/><br/><a href="https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/rakeoff/" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/rakeoff/</a><br/><br/>The project is still quite young, so there may be the odd bug, and mistakes in the documentation. It is a relatively active project though, so I'm always working on improving it and fixing any issues. The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/rakeoff/wiki/Home" target="_blank">wiki</a> probably explains the framework best, but as a sample snippet here's what one of my typical build files now looks like:</p> <blockquote class="code"><pre><br />$: &lt;&lt; File.expand_path('build/src')<br/>require 'build'<br /><br />task :default =&gt; [:off, :clean, :configs, :compile, :unit_tests, :aspcompile, :copy]<br /><br />desc 'Copy all required folders to _release'<br />task :copy =&gt; [:copy_scripts, :copy_images]<br /><br />task :off do<br />  robocopy(:copy_scripts, 'scripts/deploy', '_output/package/scripts/deploy', '')<br />  robocopy(:copy_images,  'res/images',     '_output/package/images', '')<br />end<br /></pre></blockquote> <p>Go check it out and feel free to give me any feedback!</p>
