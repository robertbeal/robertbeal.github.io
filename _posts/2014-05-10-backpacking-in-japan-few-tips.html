<p>
  I recently visited Japan for the 4th time, and spent another three weeks there
  moving around Honshu and Kyushu seeing new places, but also returning to
  previously visited ones. In the past I've been a bit slack in giving travels
  tips on Japan, but here are some of the gems we found while we were there.

<h3>Kyoto</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ramen - our favourite Ramen was
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/114945692651084027163/about?hl=en&gl=uk"
      >Ichiran</a
    >
    (better than Gogya and Ippudo).
  </li>
  <li>
    Udon soup noodles -

      >Omen</a
    >, while expensive, is very good. There are two, the most convenient is in
    Gion.
  </li>
  <li>

      href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/ichiran/@35.019123,135.731813,3a,75y,131.37h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1svkdM2INIADLOC9T6OKcU0g!2e0"
      >Old school toy shop</a
    >
    - I bought an old Tamiya battery car (from the late 80's/early 90's) for
    Y800. The store had all sorts of old model planes, cars etc... in it.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Takayama</h3>
<a

<ul>
  <li>
    Food - Do not miss out on
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/108110360134135370113/about?hl=en&gl=uk"
      >Center For Burgers</a
    >. Get over the fact that you're eating a burger in Japan. And make sure you
    don't skimp out, order the Hida Beef Burger! It's excellent on a world class
    level and the atmosphere and staff are great. We went twice (we were in
    Takayama 2 days!).
  </li>
  <li>
    Food - for a good value local experience there's a good
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/111189339785777267521/about?hl=en&gl=uk"
      >Ramen/Noodle restaurant close to the station</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bicycle - hire a bicycle. It's worth it to get around town quickly for a day
    and visit the nearby temples and folk village. It saves a lot of time over
    walking.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're going to Shira-kawago, then don't bother with the Hida folk
    village (it's a model village rather than a lived in one) as you'll see the
    real thing in Shira-kawago. The folk village is fairly expensive at Y700 and
    not terribly interesting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@36.134003,137.235022,3a,75y,330.3h,85.35t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sURIWBWDiTrqq5fqkY4JbFQ!2e0"
      >Sukyo Mahikari</a
    >
    temple is worth a look for its shear scale and cult shivers.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's worth spending a night in Shira-kawago despite the cost. You get to see
    the village in the early/late hours without hordes of tourists around.
    Staying in one of the houses is good fun too and the food (at
    <a href="http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/ryokan-single/?ryokan=Kanja"
      >Guest House Kanja</a
    >
    at least) is excellent.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Yakushima</h3>
<a
  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/13798944634/in/set-72157643150822503"
  ><img
    class="alignright"
    alt="Hirauchi Kaichu onsen"

<ul>
  <li>
    Rent a car if you are 2 people or more. It costs more than the bus but gives
    you so much more flexibility. Being restricted to buses means a lot of
    waiting and potentially not seeing everything you'd like to.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you do decide to stick to the bus, grab a bus pass the second you get off
    the ferry. It'll save you a fair amount.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't miss out on Hirauchi Kaichu onsen by the sea. It's only Y100 and a
    very rare experience as you need to go during low tide. Take a towel!
  </li>
  <li>
    If going to Shiratani Unsuikyo don't bother with the red (easy) hiking
    route. It's paved, boring and full of tourists. The orange route is good for
    dense forest, while the green route is the best route overall and has
    Princess Mononoke-like trails.
  </li>
  <li>
    Yakusugi Land is worth a visit too. Oddly we found it more fun than
    Shiratani Unsuikyo. You need 3 hours there to get the most from the hiking
    trails.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Anbo there's a great little
    <a
      href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@30.315176,130.656214,3a,75y,81.66h,84.86t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sGSSfnYmq_wK0tjTKFAv1KQ!2e0"
      >Thai/Indian inspired restaurant, Amara</a
    >
    opened by an ex-fisherman who has learnt to cook and in the aforementioned
    countries. The food is fresh and tasty and generally good value. It's about
    100m walk past Anbo tourist office.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tsumago/Magome</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Tsumago is the more authentic looking of the two and a better place to stay
    the night.
  </li>
  <li>
    The walk between the villages is nice but nothing special compared to treks
    in places like Yakushima or Aso. So if you're going to those places,
    Tsumago/Magome could be missed. Having said that, for a couple of hours it's
    a pleasant hike. Make sure you stop in the local tea house. It's free (but
    give a donation) and run by the local community.
  </li>
</ul>
