  2011. It's been a great bike although it does have it's shortcomings (which I
  naively didn't realise upon buying it). Once I returned from the tour I
  couldn't bring myself to sell the bike given how far it had taken me. so
  decided to re-spec it with a more suitable Shimergo set up.

    >The re-spec went very well</a

  and I'm much happier with the bike, although still not entirely content. Now
  that I'm earning again I've decided to build a lightweight steel tourer the
  way I think it should be. My Croix De Fer will still be used for touring, but
  will typically become an all-weather and commuting bike.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
  Firstly, I had to think about what I wanted and expected from the bike. My
  requirements were fairly simple:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Robust</strong> - it had to be solid in build, able to withstand
    carrying my 85kg frame as well as up to 20kg of luggage while going over
    roads, tracks, fields etc...
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lightweight</strong> - it had to be as light as possible, but
    without sacrificing too much on strength/robustness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fast</strong> - it had to be a fairly fast bike in terms of build
    and geometry. I want to use it for long and short tours as well as quick
    weekend rides.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  With the above in mind I set about searching for the ideal frame and
  components.
</p>
<h3>Frame</h3>
<p>
  I had settled on steel (all of my bikes currently are) as it's strong, gives a
  good ride and can take a bashing. This however comes at the cost of it being
  heavier than other materials. I ideally wanted downtube braze-ons as well so
  that I have the option to use downtube shifters should I wish. Here are the
  contenders I found (the weights are approximate from googling):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Planet X Kaffenback - £200, 2.2kg</li>
  <li>Surly Cross Check - £315, 2.2kg</li>
  <li>Thorn Audax Mk3 - £400, 2.3kg</li>
  <li>Soma Double Cross - £400, 1.92kg</li>
  <li>Spa Titanium Tourer - £800, 2.2kg</li>
  <li>Spa Titanium Audax - £750, 1.7kg</li>
</ul>
<p>

      alt="Soma Double Cross"
      width="240"
      height="180" /></a
  >The Surly Cross Check, Planet X Kaffenback and Thorn Audax are fairly similar
  in terms of build quality and weight, being 4130 Chromoly (or thereabouts). Of
  the three, the Kaffenback would be my favourite purely because of it's price
  and versatility. The Soma Double Cross was the lightest off-the-peg steel
  frame I could find. It comes in a disc version that also had cantilever mounts
  which is very useful for future upgrades.
</p>
<p>
  I've always liked the Spa Titanium bikes but they're a bit out of my price
  range, and the tourer is actually quite heavy. The Audax would have been my
  bike of choice, but it's quite a fast bike and not as versatile as I'd like. A
  custom build Mercian with a Reynolds 853 frame would be perfect, but it's far
  too expensive for me at the moment.
</p>
<p>
  So, In the end I decided on the Soma Double Cross (the Kaffenback came in
  second). The Double Cross is very light for a steel frame and gets great
  reviews. It's also very versatile, with good tyre clearance, downtube
  braze-ons and both disc and cantilever mounts. As a comparison, the Croix De
  Fer frame (from what I've read) weighs around 2.2kg (300 grams heavier), but
  lacks downtube braze-ons and cantilever mounts.
</p>
<p>
  * Annoyingly, upon getting my Double Cross frame, on the kitchen scales it
  weighs 2140g which is 220g heavier than listed. That may not sound like a lot,
  but it's the equivalent weight of a decent cassette!
</p>
<h3>Forks</h3>
<p>
  Due to problems with stock and the £100 price tag for a set of Soma Double
  Cross forks, I decided instead to get a set of Surly Long Haul Trucker forks.
  The length of the fork is only 5mm more than the Double Cross's forks, and the
  rake 1mm more. So very similar, and perfectly suitable for my Double Cross. It
  also saved me £50 and gave me more mounting options on the front forks.
</p>
<p>
  By picking the Surly Long Haul Trucker forks, I had decided to go with rim
  brakes over disc brakes. They are cheaper, lighter, the fork more comfortable
  to ride on (over a disc fork), and provide all the braking power I need. The
  forks weighed just over a kilo uncut, and once I had cut the steerer were
  around 980g.
</p>
<h3>Transmission</h3>
<p>
  I have a Deore 26/36/48T triple on my Croix De Fer, but it is quite heavy at
  over 1kg. For my new build I decided to opt for a Shimano XT 28/40T 10-speed
  double chainset. This would offer me all the gear ratios I need, while saving
  me around 300g, and reducing the complexity of the bike by one chain ring.
</p>
<p>
  To compliment it, I got an Shimano SLX 9-speed front mech (good value to
  weight), used an existing Shimano 105 9-speed rear mech (very light) and a
  Shimano Ultegra 12-27T 9-speed cassette (very light at 220g). I had wanted a
  105 11-28T cassette, but couldn't find them available at the right price. The
  Ultegra will work fine, and save me some weight.
</p>
<p>
  Sticking with 9-speed was important for compatibility (also with my other
  bike) and powerlinks as I like to fit an SRAM powerlink's on my chains.
</p>
<h3>Brakes & Shifters</h3>
<p>
  I did have my heart set on downtube shifters with Tektro RL520 brake levers,
  which would have allowed me to use full size v-brakes (I was looking at the
  BR770 XT v-brakes). The total weight of the two is 77g + 272g, at a cost of
  around £75. After some thought and a price drop, I decided to go for a set of
  Campagnolo Centaur Ergoshifters (which I have on my Croix De Fer). They are
  comfortable, work well, at 375g are very light and at £116 very affordable (I
  got them on discount).
</p>
<p>
  The shifters determined that I would either have to go for cantilever brakes
  or mini v-brakes. The Tektro CR720's and Tektro RX5's were the two main
  contenders. Given Spa Cycles had recently switched their bikes to the RX5 mini
  v-brakes I decided to copy them! At £15 a pair they were good value and they
  are light. The only annoyance with them is that they cable really needs to be
  completely loosened in order to get the wheel off.
</p>
<h3>Wheels & Tyres</h3>
<p>
  I already had a set of hand-built wheels courtesy of Spa Cycles, a pair of
  Rigida Snyper 36-spoke wheels, one of which has a SON28 dynamo. For speed I'll
  initially be running a set of Continental Gatorskins 25C on them. They also
  only weigh 330g which is very light for a fairly good puncture resistant tyre.

  >Once everything was on, and allowing for any missed little bits of weight,
  the bike weighs in at 10.3kg (with my road wheels on, race saddle, and rack
  removed) and 11.3kg in full touring trim. It's close to my target, but a
  little over. I had wanted a race trim of under 10kg, and a touring trim of
  under 11kg. This could easily be fixed by dropping the dynamo hub and
  switching the Brooks B17 for something lighter. The dynamo is something I
  definitely could last without, although I'm not sure about the Brooks, so the
  additional weight may be worth it. The Shimano XT Chainset is fantastic and so
  far has worked very well. The bike in general feels comfortable yet still very
  nippy when climbing.
