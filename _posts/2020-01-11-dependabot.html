<p>
  Dependabot is one of a handful of tools I see as a must-have tool in a DevOps culture and something we heavily use at LandTech. 
  Acquired by GitHub in 2019, it is a free bot application that checks for dependency updates, creates pull requests and can even 
  merge them for you. So why is this a must-have tool?
</p>

<h2>Something I don't like doing as an engineer</h2>

<p>
  At LandTech we manage thousands of dependencies across all of our codebase. Regularly upgrading such code dependencies is not something 
  that gives me joy, nor would I imagine does it most engineers. And as part of that it is not something
  I do nearly often enough. I've seen endless codebases where dependencies are months or even years behind, long out of support. More often that not
  it is not seen as a probem until something needs to be changed and takes far, far longer than it should. Or arguably even worse, a breach or 
  security incident occurs due to upatched dependencies. 
</p>

<h2>A different way...</h2>

<p>
  By having Dependabot track and create pull requests for dependency updates it takes away something engineers have to be mindful of, eating
  up part of their mental capacity. It allows codebases to stay up-to-date, securely patched, within support and reduces the feedback time it takes
  to find a breaking change (we don't have to fix the breaking change, but we are aware and have the option to). Largely meaning codebase change 
  remains easy and fast rather than slowing over time and increasing in difficulty. 
</p>

<h2>Full automation</h2>

<p>
  However, merely tracking dependencies and creating pull requests still requires input from engineers to approve them, which can quickly
  stack up, and becomes yet another thing to remember to do.
</p>

<p>
  Enter auto-merging, an advanced feature in Dependabot to automatically merge pull requests given any necessary continuous integration steps have passed.
  Auto-merging can be something people struggle to agree with... What it my app breaks? What if there's an outage? I often return to the same question I 
  always ask... What do you need to put in place to give you the confidence that it won't? Need more tests? Then add more tests. Need
  dark/canary deploys with auto rollbacks based off metrics? Then add that too!
</p>

<p>
  It does mean investing time in such things, but it is time well spent. You end up with a more robust CI/CD pipeline enabling you to auto-merge 
  code dependency updates. Applications stay up-to-date, in support, secure and easy to change. And engineers can focus more time on delivering 
  value rather than operational overhead.
