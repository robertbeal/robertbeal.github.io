<p><a href="http://www.robertbeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/belgium.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1435" title="belgium" src="http://www.robertbeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/belgium-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" /></a>The roads out of France across the <span>Ardennes</span> and into Lorraine were great. Fast, smooth and very picturesque. It was a Sunday too so fairly quiet in terms of traffic. However, once I left France, southern Belgium was a big disappointment. Very industrial and lacking any type of character. It seemed to smell of asparagus</span> too. It was nothing to write home about so I churned through the 50km of Belgium quickly to get on to Luxembourg in the hope it would be more interesting.</p><a name='more'></a> <h3>Luxembourg</h3> <p>Thankfully it was better (on both counts). A bit more character started to return to the surroundings, and I even managed to take in a pro-cycle race (unfortunately it wasn't Le Tour). Entering Luxembourg city was like any other city, lots of cars and busy roads so my pace slowed. Once I reached the centre I continued on foot. The centre is pedestrianised and mostly cobbled streets lined with fashion shops, cafes and restaurants. My only day there was a Sunday, but despite that restaurants were packed, people sat out in the main square, and live music played in one of the smaller squares. This continued until well after midnight. I took in a few beers and enjoyed a pizza while people watching in the square. It wasn't cheap!</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/5902253563/in/set-72157626993093341/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6048/5902253563_a619c8188f_m.jpg" alt="Entering Belgium" width="160" height="240" /></a></p> <h3>Fully Booked</h3> <p>Unfortunately the hostel was fully booked the next day. Because of this I had booked ahead to stay at a hotel in Trier but without knowing how much I'd enjoy Luxembourg. Otherwise I would have looked for somewhere else to stay to spend an additional day there. The hostel was a large hostel that had the decor and character of a hospital. It wasn't a great hostel (I tend not to like larger family based one) but at â‚¬20 the location was perfect.</p> <p>The next morning I had breakfast in town and sat outside a cafe watching Luxembourg slowly awaken. I got on the bike and started my cycle towards Germany.</p> <ul>    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/sets/72157626993093341/map/" target="_blank">Photos Map</a></li>    <li>        <strong>GPS Data</strong>        <ol>            <li><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/100164813" target="_blank">Douzy &gt; Luxembourg City (98km)</a></li>            <li><del>Luxembourg City &gt; Trier (62km)</del></li>        </ol>    </li>    <li><strong>Favourite Place</strong> - Luxembourg City</li>	     <li><strong>Revisit</strong> - Luxembourg City (definitely)</li>    <li><strong>Duration</strong> - 2 days</li>    <li><strong>Typical Mileage</strong> - 90-100km</li></ul>
