Another sunny day with passing cloud cover so we had to put loads of sun block on. By this point the bum cream was still working, but we'd begun to start conditioning to saddle rub. It would still take another few days though until it wasn't so much of an issue. It's not something you can totally get rid of, but you get to a point where it's not much of an issue.</p> <p>The ride was quite pleasant up through Gloucestershire and into Shropshire, although not as interesting or enjoyable as Cornwall and Devon. We passed through fewer villages, most of the route being roads with farms either side. There were some excellent roads at the beginning of the trip, very fast and plenty of bends so quite exciting. We just had to be careful with oncoming cars which nearly caught me out at one point. The day was one of our shorter ones in the UK, so passed by quite quickly.</p><a name='more'></a> <p>We arrived at Church Stretton at around 6pm, grabbed some food in the local supermarket, then headed up to the All Stretton bunkhouse. It turned out to be an amazing hostel. It was very small, could only accomodate around 10 people if that, but was beautifully kept, very cheap, and felt a bit like staying in a house rather than a hostel. Once we had eaten and showered, it was a little late to venture around the local area. There was a Marco Pierre White pub, The Yew Tree Inn down the road which would have been nice to have a beer at.</p>
