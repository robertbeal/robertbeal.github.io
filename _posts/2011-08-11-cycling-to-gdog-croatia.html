I had been 8 years before and really liked the country and people so was happy to be back. As I entered a huge thunderstorm ran along side my towards Hungary with flashes of lightning and cracks of thunder. I smiled to myself, glad I was out of Hungary. I sped on, averaging over 30kmh as the thunderstorm a bit too close for comfort. It was quite exciting being so close yet not actually in it (like I'm used to). I was so close that when the wind changed direction I could feel spots of rain. This continued for around 20km until it started to change direction!</p><a name='more'></a> <h3>Soaked</h3> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/6014412931/in/photostream"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6147/6014412931_2d2a10b90d_m.jpg" alt="Massive storm coming" width="240" height="160" /></a>I kept up my pace but it eventually caught me. I took cover under a tree, but the rain was so hard it came through the leaves and I was soaked within 20 minutes. The lightning and thunder were directly above me, so close the thunder made me jump a few times. It was one of the biggest thunderstorms I can remember being in. I eventually got cycling again, but slowly as the roads often had streams of water running down them, most of which ended up in my shoes. I didn't mind though and eventually cycled out of the thunderstorm. I later stopped to squeeze all of the water out of my gloves, clothes and socks.</p> <h3>Oakley</h3> <p>A couple of weeks ago I had placed an order for some Oakley's via their website. The prices were so low I bought two pairs, one casual pair for myself, and some M frames for my brother's birthday (as I've been so impressed by the ones I bought in Vienna). The cheap prices turned out to be a mis-price though, and Oakley cancelled the order. Amazingly though Oakley did a u-turn and reinstated the orders, but for completely free! Quite an amazing gesture. Knowing I'm getting £400 worth of glasses for free killed off the memory of the thefts in Hungary, and kept me warm during the thunderstorm.</p> <h3>Osijek</h3> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/6014976758/in/photostream"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6030/6014976758_8bb09bbb82_m.jpg" alt="Osijek backstreet" width="240" height="160" /></a>My first stop was a small town that on numerous occasions has all but been destroyed (and re-built). The old town was nice enough and interesting to walk around although it didn't really grab me. To make matters worse my hostel (Hostel Tufna) was the floor above a night club. Even with earplugs in the booming bass could easily be heard and went on until 4am. I was also in a "5 bed room", yet it had 10 beds. And in general it was quite dirty. Not a pleasant experience.</p> <h3>Ilok</h3> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/6014465069/in/photostream"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/6014465069_576da3387b_m.jpg" alt="Water tower monument" width="160" height="240" /></a>The next day I cycled towards the Croatia/Serbia border to a town called Ilok. Despite only being around 85km the day had a few challenges. Constant 8% hills, which aren't too steep by English standards, but in the 30C heat of the day and doing around 8 of them, so I started to tire. Also every hill was "8%" despite varying in gradient. I think Croatia either made too many 8% signs and wanted to use them up, or only has one sign in production. The Euro Velo 6 route throughout Croatia is mostly roads (95% of the time) but I found them quite bearable. They're smooth which was quite a blessing after Hungary, so I could maintain a fast, constant speed. And the the traffic wasn't as bad as I thought it would be (much like going along a b-road in England). Once in Ilok I gave up trying to find a guest-house and booked myself into the Hotel Duna, a 3 star hotel right on the river. It was a nice slice of luxury although cost me £37 for the night. Tomorrow I cross into Serbia!</p> <ul>    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bealer/sets/72157627374853494/" target="_blank">Photos Map</a></li>    <li>        <strong>GPS Data</strong>        <ol>            <li><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/104455939" target="_blank">Osijek &gt; Ilok (103km)</a></li>            <li><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/104457290" target="_blank">Ilok &gt; Novi Sad (78km)</a></li>        </ol>    </li>    <li><strong>Favourite Place</strong> - The coast</li>	     <li><strong>Revisit</strong> - Not that part but I like Trogir on the coast</li>    <li><strong>Duration</strong> - 2 days</li></ul>
