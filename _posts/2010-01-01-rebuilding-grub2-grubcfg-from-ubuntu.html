<p>After installing Windows 7 the other day I lost my Grub install. Not a problem, in the past I've used my <a href="http://www.supergrubdisk.org/" target="_blank">Super Grub Disc</a> to repair it.</p> <p>This didn't work for me though (may be my disc is a bit dated, or maybe it doesn't support grub 2 just yet). Instead I booted up using my Ubuntu 9.10 Live CD. I could easily re-install grub using the "grub-install" command.</p><a name='more'></a> <ol>    <li>Open up a terminal</li>    <li>sudo apt-get install grub-pc (install grub2 incase the live version doesn't have it)</li>    <li>sudo fdisk -l</code> (Find the partition you want)</li>    <li>sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt (Mount the partition)</li>    <li>sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda</li></ol> <p>I've used the drive <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>/dev/sda</strong></span> and partition <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/dev/sda5</span></strong> in my example. Notice the exact spelling.</p> <p>This all went ok, but I was left with a screwed up grub menu (I messed it up myself). There's a "update-grub" command you can do from within Ubuntu, but I couldn't actually boot in. I only had the Live CD. Hence updating it proved to be quite difficult, and there's nothing on the Live CD to help. I eventually found a solution, these are the commands I had to run in order to regenerate it (you can copy and paste the whole lot to run them all at once).</p> <blockquote><code>sudo mkdir /mnt &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo chroot /mnt bash &amp;&amp;<br/>sudo update-grub &amp;&amp;<br/>reboot; </code></blockquote> <p>Without binding the /dev and /proc it would throw an error.</p> <p>All credit goes to <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7903302&amp;postcount=11" target="_blank">seeker5528's post</a> for the above solution.</p> <p>If you simply want to update grub2, and you are able to boot into linux, then you can run the command:</p> <blockquote><code>sudo update-grub</code></blockquote> <p>It will rebuild your grub config, finding all the available bootable partitions.</p>
