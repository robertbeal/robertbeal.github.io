<p>In recent months I've become a dedicated <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a> user, and finally decided to drop Rhythmbox (bit dated / behind with the times) and Songbird (too slow for the size of collection I have). As of around v1.5.2 in Banshee they had fixed the slow load-up, and added a filesystem watcher. With those two things fixed, I made the switch.</p> <p>I currently run the latest version of Banshee via the PPA, but recently had the problem of Banshee crashing a lot. I gather it's from incompatible data between an older version I was running and the latest version. It was upon using v1.5.4 that if I tried to access certain tracks it would just crash.</p> <p>I ran Banshee via terminal and checked the logs, but couldn't get much info back. After reading around I found rebuilding the Banshee database fixed the issue, and allowed me to keep my library intact. This can be done by running:</p> <blockquote>sudo apt-get install -y sqlite3 &amp;&amp;<br/>sqlite3 ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db ".dump" &gt; dump &amp;&amp;<br/>mv ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db banshee.db.backup &amp;&amp;<br/>cat dump | sqlite3 ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db; </blockquote> <p>It basically dumps out your old database and recreates it. Thanks to gabaug for the fix.</p>
