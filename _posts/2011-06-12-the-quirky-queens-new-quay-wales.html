Come dinner time we started to look for somewhere to eat. Luckily we had walked into the town down the one-way exit road (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vapD" target="_blank">A486, top of Church Street</a>) and noticed a pub called The Queens (or now The Quirky Queens), still sat in the evening sun unlike most of the pubs in the town.</p><a name='more'></a> <p>Being on the exit road, and up the top of a fairly steep hill it may not get a huge amount of attention. It does however face roughly westward so it'll get more of the sun in the evening than most of the town (which faces north). Great for those Summer days sitting out in the sun.</p> <p>Inside it lives up to its name and really is quite "quirky", yet still has a great pub feel to it. There is a second hand book shop as part of the pub, which just adds to the unique feel of the pub, while inside the pub itself feels warm and cosy. Outside there is plenty of seating although given it was April we chose to sit indoors.</p> <p>Finally the food and drink was excellent. What you get depends upon the barrels they've got in at the time, but expect some great ales and real ciders from the local areas. It was a pleasant change from the typical, we've got Foster's, Carling and Kronenbourg offerings. We could have easily spent the whole night there if we didn't have to head off to find a wild camping spot.</p> <p>The food was one of the best meals we had during our trip of Wales. I opted for the chicken sizzler which comes with hand-cut chips, honey mustard sauce and onion rings. It is served just as the name suggests, on a sizzling hot plate, all freshly cooked. For around Â£7 it offers great value.</p> <p>To top it off the owners (?) were polite and friendly, as were the locals making it the most welcoming pub we visited in Wales. So if you're in New Quay I recommend you give the Quirky Queens a try.</p>
