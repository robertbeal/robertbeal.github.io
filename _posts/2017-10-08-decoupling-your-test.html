  Connascence is a quality metric for describing how coupled two systems are, or
  in the terms of this example, how coupled our implementation class and test
  class are. Because it describes levels of coupling (in a structured order, see
  below) we can use it to help prioritise what should be refactored first.

<p>
  As always there is a trade off in how far down the chart you work but from
  personal experience I usually find beyond Connascence of Meaning the value
  starts to drop off. I'll go over a simple example (so take it with a pinch of
  salt) that should show firstly, how to clean up your code, but also how you
  could end up with a better solution. Oh, and excuse my python (if it's not
  overly pythonic), I'm not a native python coder. In the below example I'll
  tackle two of the types of Connascence.
</p>

<h3>Fizz Buzz</h3>

<p>
  A very typical kata most of you may have come across at some point in time.
  The requirements are very simple.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You count in numbers, starting at 0, incremeting one at a time</li>
  <li>For numbers divisible by 3, you say "Fizz"</li>
  <li>For numbers divisible by 5, you say "Buzz"</li>
  <li>
    For numbers divisible by 3 or 5, you say the rules in their above order, ie
    "FizzBuzz"
  </li>
  <li>If the number does not match a rule, you say the number, ie "4"</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy! Right let's start test driving this...</p>

{% highlight python %} class FizzBuzz(object): def say(self, input): if input %
3 == 0: return "Fizz" return input class TestFizzBuzz(unittest.TestCase): def
test_it_says_Fizz_for_numbers_divisible_by_3(self): for i in range(1, 100):
value = i*3 self.assertEqual("Fizz", FizzBuzz().say(value)) {% endhighlight %}

<p>
  I've not gone overly purist, and I've jumped in at getting "Fizz" to work. A
  first test that passes as simply as I can make it. Many people may stop here
  and move on to coding "Buzz", but I'd like to first tackle some coupling.
  First up is <strong>Connascence of Value</strong> in that both my
  implementation and test share knowledge of "Fizz" and "3". I'll fix this first
  by injecting the values into my implementation so that my test can control the
  scenario:
</p>

{% highlight python %} class FizzBuzz(object): def __init__(self, number,
value): self.number = number self.value = value def say(self, input): if input %
self.number == 0: return self.value return input class
TestFizzBuzz(unittest.TestCase): def
test_it_says_if_divisible_by_a_specified_number(self): number = randint(1, 9)
word = str(uuid.uuid4()) for i in range(1, 100): value = i*number
self.assertEqual(word, FizzBuzz(number, word).say(value)) {% endhighlight %}

<p>
  In the above I've fixed <strong>Connascence of Value</strong>, and in doing so
  I'm able to randomise the number and word said (as it doesn't matter what they
  are). Contextually, if it can divide by the number, the word gets said.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily I've no <strong>Connascence of Timing</strong> (the timing of the
  execution of code doesn't impact me) or
  <strong>Connascence of Execution Order</strong> (nor does execution order of
  the implementation code affect me) and arguably no Connascence of Position.
</p>

<p>
  I am however breaking <strong>Connascence of Algorithm</strong> as both my
  implementation and test know that it's a multiple of a number. They are
  coupled by both having to know the same "algorithm", in this case a simple mod
  0. So let's fix this, again by injecting in the "algorithm" so that the test
  controls the scenario...
</p>

{% highlight python %} class FizzBuzz(object): def __init__(self, rule, value):
self.rule = rule self.value = value def say(self, input): if self.rule(input):
return self.value return input class TestFizzBuzz(unittest.TestCase): def
test_it_says_if_the_rule_applies(self): word = str(uuid.uuid4())
self.assertEqual(word, FizzBuzz((lambda i: True), word).say(0)) {% endhighlight
%}

<p>
  In removing the <strong>Connascence of Algorithm</strong> I'm able to
  competely change the context of my test. Instead of passing in a number I just
  need to pass in a lambda expression (which would be "lambda i: i % 3 == 0").
  In the case of my test though, I don't care what the expression is, only that
  if it returns true, then FizzBuzz will say the word. I can also easily add a
  negative test case:
</p>

{% highlight python %} def
test_it_says_the_number_if_the_rule_does_not_apply(self): word =
str(uuid.uuid4()) self.assertEqual(0, FizzBuzz((lambda i: False), word).say(0))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Next up I hit <strong>Connascence of Meaning</strong> (an example would be,
  returning an int to represent a monetary value. Is it pence? Pounds? Dollars?
  Cents? etc...). This basic kata isn't really affected by it, so I'll halt my
  refactoring there. In terms of testing "Buzz" I'm already covered by the above
  tests. The next step would be to test saying two rules, ie "FizzBuzz" at which
  point I'd fix only injecting a single rule/word, for an array of rules/words.
</p>

<p>
  So where are the actual rules now that I've extracted them out? And how are
  they tested? Separately of course, and easily testable. Here a Rules class I
  eventually ended up making (that gets injected into my FizzBuzz class) that
  represents my configuration:
</p>

{% highlight python %} class Rules(list): def __init__(self):
list.__init__(self) self.append(Rule((lambda i: i % 3 == 0), 'Fizz'))
self.append(Rule((lambda i: i % 5 == 0), 'Buzz')) {% endhighlight %}

<p>
  In terms of testing the above class, all I need to test is that a rule exists
  in the array for "Fizz" and for "Buzz". I'm effectively just testing my
  configuration is correct, not the logic arround how rules/words are applied.
  Using Connascence I've been able to decouple my tests, and in doing so it's
  help drive out a solution where I've decoupled configuration from function. My
  FizzBuzz class doesn't need to know the details of the rules, it just applies
  them if necessary.
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>
  To take a step back and look at the problem again...FizzBuzz is (as I know it)
  a drinking game. New rules are constantly added as the game progresses (making
  it harder and harder so more drink is consumed). If a rule applies, you say a
  specified word. If not you say a number. The above solution I've ended up with
  makes it very easy to add new rules without needing to change a lot of code.
  It's only when rules overide other rules etc... (new features!) that things
  get more complicated, but the code is in a good/flexible position to adapt now
  that I've refactored it and reduced coupling.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  I've a nearly finished solution (lacking a couple of configuration tests)
  here: https://github.com/robertbeal/kata-fizzbuzz-py although keep in mind it
  only shows the destination, not the journey (so to speak). And while the above
  does test configuration and function, you would still compliment it with
  higher level tests as well.
</p>

<p>
  This post is just a very simplistic example of using Connascence to decouple
  your tests. I've not covered all of the levels of Connascence (although please
  click any links above for code examples) but I hope it shows a rough idea of
  how effective it can be at improving your code quality. It's obviously much
  easier to apply to a kata like FizzBuzz than "real" code, but that's something
  that comes with practise. All I can say is that once you try it (and see the
  light) you'll get hooked as it's quite an eye-opening, measurable tool for
  improving code quality.
