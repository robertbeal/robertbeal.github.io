  A leadership philosophy by Robert K. Greenleaf first introduced in the essay
  "The Servant as Leader" published in 1970 that I like to apply and find is
  often misunderstood... here's what it means to me and why I try to consciously
  learn and apply it in work and life...
</p>

<h2>Firstly, what it isn't...</h2>

<p>
  Servant leadership isn't about being an easy or soft leader unable to make
  decisions. Or literally "serving" people doing their work. Nor does it mean
  you won't have to make difficult decisions or any decisions at all. It's far
  more complex than simply being "nice" (not that I'm adverse to being nice!
  Everyone should be whether at work or not).
</p>

<h2>So what is it?</h2>

<p>
  For me it's about "excellence, the ruthless persuit of perfection, the urgency
  to achieve the mission, constant dissatisfaction with the status quo and a
  zeal for helping those around you" to mostly quote Gene Kim. I had to go
  through a number of realisations to truly appreciate and understand it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A leader's availability/capacity (or lack of) should not block, slow or
    stall progress
  </li>
  <li>
    The further decisions are made from where they need to be, the poorer they
    will be
  </li>
  <li>
    The further decisions are made from where they need to be, the slower they
    will be
  </li>
  <li>
    A single point of failure (not just technical, but human too) can cause an
    entire system to stop
  </li>
  <li>"Two heads are better than one"</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The aim... to get the best out of those around you by putting them before
  yourself, building trust... and inspiring, empowering, supporting, and guiding
  in order to build a team of leaders. It's by no means an easy philosophy to
  learn/apply as it heavily relies on empathy, observation, awareness, influence
  and foresight. But beyond being a more enjoyable and rewarding way of working
  (for me), there are numerous benefits and performance improvements, some
  proven in
  <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust"
    >neuroscientific studies</a
  >:
</p>

<p>
  <em
    >"Compared with people at low-trust companies, people at high-trust
    companies report: 74% less stress, 106% more energy at work, 50% higher
    productivity, 13% fewer sick days, 76% more engagement, 29% more
    satisfaction with their lives, 40% less burnout."</em

<h2>In examples...</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    A team comes to me to make a decision around frontend architecture options.
    Am I best placed to? Nope. Do I have the necessary knowledge or involvment
    relative to those doing the work? Nope. Could I guide and facilitate the
    team to make a decision. Yes!
  </li>
  <li>
    The team need to make a decision fast but I'm on holiday/in meetings/at
    lunch/sick etc... Do they heavily rely on me so wait until I'm back to make
    a decision? If yes, then I'm blocking progress. Or do they feel confident,
    empowered and prepared enough to make a decision? If not, then I'm failing
    as a leader, am a dependency, single point of failure and delaying progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    We discuss a problem. I put forward my decision (a terrible choice). Am I
    human? Yes. Will I make mistakes? Yes. However, the other team members
    grown, empowered and experienced in such situations point out the failings
    in my choice. We collectively make a better decision with a better outcome.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  My aim...as a servant leader, if I were to suddenly magicly disappear and the
  team (after the shock, if any, of me disappearing) could not only maintain but
  continue to improve their performance and way of working, then I've been a
  successful leader. Simple.
