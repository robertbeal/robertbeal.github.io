* I do now have a
<a href="http://www.robertbeal.com/696/lejog-final-kit-list"
  >finalised kit list</a
>, with photos, which I wrote up a few weeks after doing this post.<br /><br />As
usual cycling has been my biggest interest of late as the Summer weather begins
to come into play. This year I've decided (after writing it off at first) to try
and cycle 1,000 miles from Lands End to John O'Groats (LEJOG) on my Boardman Pro
Carbon road racing bike.<br /><br />I was initially put off, as my bike, being a
carbon fibre competition bike, doesn't have any pannier mount points and
typically isn't really built for long distance in terms of riding position
etc... The lure of such a ride was too much though, and I pushed ahead with
figuring out how I could achieve it.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<h3>Bags</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    <a
      href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=28709"
      target="_blank"
      >Topeak Dynapack DX</a
    >
    (10L) - £60
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <a
      href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=28763"
      target="_blank"
      >Topeak Barpack Handlebar Bag</a
    >
    (1.8L) - £30
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <a
      href="http://www.snowandrock.com/the-north-face-hammerhead/hydration-packs/ski-snowboard-outdoor-sports/fcp-product/6520"
      target="_blank"
      >North Face Hammerhead</a
    >
    (12L) - £40
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />This gives me 10 + 1.8 = 11.8 litres of storage space approximately. Plus
I'll probably fill my Hammerhead with around 3L of stuff, but want to keep that
as light as possible to avoid back pains.<br /><br />Given I can't use panniers
(no mounts on my bike), I managed to find a seat post mounted bag, the Topeak
DynaPack DX. A clever, light design, and relatively attractive, it offers 10
litres of space. This will be used to carry the bulk of my stuff. To compliment
it, I have a 1.8 litre Topeak Barpack Handlebar Bag on the handle bars (with
padding removed) and will soon have a frame pouch (once I've settled on one).
Unfortunately with the DynaPack DX you can't also have a saddle bag, unless you
seat post is at least 15cm out of the frame. Anything less and the saddle bag
just won't be able to fit.<br /><br />I have included the North Face Hammerhead
bag. I did want to keep my back clear of carrying any weight, but the beg is
necessary for carrying odd bits I can't fit into the 10 litre rear bag. It has a
small reservoir too, so should I really need to, I can carry additional water
(I'll try to avoid doing so though).<br />
<h3>What to fill them with...</h3>
<br />Travelling light, the plan is to re-wash a lot of the stuff I take with me
so that I'm able to take less. The below list is quite long, but most things are
small, and it all packs down easily.<br />

<h3>Considerations</h3>
<br />I'm still undecided but may also take a set of overshoes. Purely as, from
experience, I don't like when my feet get wet and cold. Especially if it's for a
whole day. The only downside is that for what they are, they're relatively
bulky. I've got a set of Gore Road Overshoes.<br /><br />Also we've tried to
keep "group" stuff to a minimum. I'd rather we were individually self
sufficient, just in case someone drops out part way round etc...<br />
<h3>Ride &amp; Feel</h3>
<br />With all the gear on, the bike surprisingly feels very good. The balance
isn't too bad, the extra weight that can't be really noticed. The only time I've
noticed the balance is a little bit off, is when turning at slow speed, or
"leaning" to turn at high speed. There's a bit more "lean-in" due to the
additional weight coming under the force of gravity. Even when climbing out of
the saddle the bike didn't feel hugely different when working it from side to
side, although I did struggle a little more not being used to the additional
weight.<br /><br />I've ridden through London (peak hours) and felt absolutely
fine. It had originally been a little concerned as my carbon fibre bike is built
for a specific balance, and me adding a bag hanging off the rear, and one on the
handle bars wasn't going to help that. It however wasn't much of an issue.<br /><br />Once
I've got most of the kit I'll start packing it and getting some photos.
