  rugged steel bike and has all the necessary characteristics to be a tourer.
  However, it wasn't as simple a conversion as I would have liked, mainly due to
  the disc brake calipers and gearing ratios. Given I couldn't find much on
  Google from other Croix De Fer owners, I thought I'd document the changes.

<h3>Update</h3>

  While the below article will have a few helpful nuggets of information, I've

  even further! It did mean rebuilding a lot of the transmission though
  (something I did when my original set up became tired).
</p>
<h3>The Bike</h3>
<p>
  My Genesis Croix De Fer, stock build, 56cm, weighing in at
  <strong>11.8kg</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Rack</h3>

    >Madison Ridge Disc</a
  >
  (460g) - I opted for this rack over the Topeak Super Tourist. Firstly, it's
  about £10-15 cheaper than the Topeak. If you google around you should be able
  to find it for £15-20. It's also lighter than the Topeak rack by around 200g
  weighing in at 460g. It is simple is design, sturdy, and fits my Ortlieb Back
  Roller Plus panniers very well. The maximum load it can take is 25kg which is
  well within what I'll be carrying on the rear (usually no more than 13kg). The
  only thing I don't like about the rack is how wide it sits, meaning my
  panniers stick and inch or two further out. Not a huge problem, but it makes
  my bike wider and less aerodynamic.
</p>
<p>
  Fitting the rack was fairly easy. It comes with small tubes that the bolts
  pass through, and then screw into the frame mounts. I found these to be too
  long, and had to force the frame wider than it naturally was so that it would
  fit. Instead I used a hacksaw to take around 8-9mm off each tube. This meant
  the rack fitted perfectly without needing to force it.
</p>
<p>
  There is the possibility of lowering the rack too. It has holes drilled so you
  can set the height, but on the lowest setting the rack still sits comfortably
  above my rear wheel. I've not done it yet, but it would mean drilling an
  additional two holes on either side of the rack to lower it another 2-4cm. It
  would lower the weight on the rear of the bike slightly... no idea if it'll
  make any difference!
</p>
<p>
  I could actually, with a couple of washers, fit the rack without the spacing
  tubes but it meant squeezing the rack by 32mm (or so). If set perfectly
  upright, it only makes fractional impact on part of the brake caliper (hence
  using a couple of spacers to avoid that). However, squeezing it puts a bit too
  much tension into the rack and won't be good for the weld points. It did make
  me wonder if I really needed a disc specific rack though. Having said that,
  for the price and weight it's hard to find a better rack.
</p>
<p>
  I recently contacted Madison, who advised on not squeezing the rack inwards as
  it'll affect the integrity and also invalidate the warranty. They wouldn't
  advise me on cutting the tubes so that the rack didn't need to be forced
  outwards, but did say that cutting them so that the rack sat naturally sounded
  like a good idea.

<h3>Mudguards</h3>

    target="_blank"
    >SKS Chromoplastics 45mm</a
  >
  (530g) - a fairly decent set of mudguards if a little bit fiddly to get on.
  45mm is just about perfect for a 35mm or 32mm tire. I'm just hoping that
  during long tours, and flights they'll be ok. They weigh around 530g so a fair
  weight to add, but what they add in weight they save in crap getting flung all
  over you and your bike.
</p>
<p>
  To fit them I did have a few issues. For the rear guard you have to bend one
  rod ever so slightly on the disc brake caliper side. The Croix De Fer has a
  second set of mounts (first set are for the rack) for the mudguards. The bolts
  provided didn't fit, so in the end I used two spare bolts from the Madison
  Ridge Rack, and used the cut-offs of the tubes for the rack as spacers. The
  bolts still didn't fit quite right, but they're in now. I just hope I haven't
  ruined the mounts.

  >For the front guard, you have to bend one of the disc brake caliper rods
  quite a bit for it to fit. I did this by hand once the guard was fitted. For
  both mudguards I had to cut around 1cm off the end of each rod so that the
  mudguards were uniformly flushed to the tires. I also had to bend the brace on
  the front guard that attaches to the front fork. I bent the top of the brace
  slightly, so that the brace can sit as high as possible for reasonable
  clearance from the tire. I didn't have a proper way of attaching the brace, so
  used the longest bolt supplied, passed it right through the fork, and secured
  it using a spare nut I found in my toolbox. You should be able to see it in
  the pictures. There's quite a bit of spare thread. I either place on
  shortening the bolt (by cutting the end off) or leaving it as is, as I may fit
  a dynamo light to the front fork.

<h3>Cassette</h3>

    >Shimano Deore HG61 9-speed 11-28T</a
  >
  - by default the Croix De Fer comes with a compact chainset 50/34T and a
  12-25T cassette. For road use this is great but for touring, fully loaded, I
  quickly run out of gears. The most expensive solution is to replace the
  chainset with a triple, but that requires a new chainset and bottom bracket.
  The second option is a 32T cassette, but this would mean a long cage rear
  derailleur and longer chain. I opted for a 11-28T cassette (cheapest option as
  I only need the cassette at around £30) and used some of the smaller cogs from
  the Croix De Fer's original cassette to make a 12-28T cassette. On the two
  largest cogs the rear derailleur is fairly tight, and rear mech stretched, but
  for now I'm happy with it. The additional 3 teeth make quite a difference.
</p>
<p>
  To get the optimum setup I did need to screw the b-tension screw on the rear
  mech out just about all the way so that the mech could handle the chain being
  on the biggest front and rear cog.
</p>
<h3>Saddle</h3>
<p>
  Brooks B17 (+350g) - an investment (they last for years), and far more
  comfortable saddle than the stock Genesis one. It adds more weight, and costs
  around £60, but I think it's well worth it as I usually don't need to wear
  padded shorts when using it. I just need to put in some mileage to get it
  broken in.
</p>
<h3>Dynamo</h3>

  >A Schmidt SON28 hub (with disc mount) on a set of Rigida Snyper rims (36
  spoke for more strength) and a new 6-bolt 160mm rotor. Annoyingly the SON28
  has a 6-bolt disc mount instead of the centre-lock mount used by default on
  the Croix De Fer. So it now means I have two types of disc mount. It's hard to
  judge but I think the wheel (without tire) adds around 200g over the stock
  wheel.
</p>
<p>
  I could have gone for a Shimano T665 hub, which does have a centre-lock mount
  and is cheaper, but it wasn't available anywhere. The SON28 in the long run,
  should be a better investment.
</p>
<h3>Tyres</h3>
<p>

    >Schwalbe Marathon 32C tires</a
  >
  - a steal at £20 each and much smoother than the stock tires. They are a solid
  choice of touring tire. In retrospect though, I think I should have gone for
  Marathon Supreme's 28C, at £7 each more. Slightly narrower, and much lighter.
  The Marathon's are 620g each whereas a 28C Supreme is 310g. That's a saving of
  0.6kg over two wheels. The Supreme is a folding tire too, so easy to carry one
  as a spare.
</p>
<h3>Final Weight</h3>
<p>
  With all of the above changes my 56cm Croix De Fer weighs in around
  <strong>13.6kg</strong>. It's fairly heavy for a lightweight tourer, I had
  hoped it would be closer to 12.5kg all in, but for now I'm happy with it. A
  change of tires and it could be 13.0kg.
