  ><strong>5th August 2010</strong> - Today was a typical LEJOG day in terms of
  distance, and was set to be a day of heavy rain. But fortunately we seemed to
  miss all of the rain and didn't see a single drop. The temperature was still a
  fair bit lower than England, the high only being around 17C. We set off
  following Loch Ness up to its most northern point. The route was quite scenic,
  although the road often moved away from the loch to the point that you
  couldn't really see much apart from trees. The roads were typically very fast,
  and on occasion dual carriage way, which wasn't terrible pleasant. We passed
  through a few small towns, Beauly was very nice (we sat outside the old
  church) and walked around the ruins.

  As we left Dingwall we had to join some dual carriageway (part of the A9), but
  this ranked as something similar to the A1. It was fast moving dual
  carriageway, with plenty of lorries zooming past us. I lead and pushed a fast
  pace, as I find it's safer if you're going as close to the speed of the
  traffic as possible, and also so that it was over sooner. Once we were off the
  A9 the roads became a lot more enjoyable. They still weren't country lanes,
  and we couldn't go side-by-side, but they were a long way better than what
  we'd just been on. We also knew it was the last of the really busy, fast roads
  we'd have to go on which was a relief.
</p>
<p>
  In fact the roads became quite nice and the landscape totally changed as we
  passed Stittenham. It didn't feel or look like Scotland. We could have been in
  Canada or eastern Europe. There were forests all around us, looking very
  untouched and earthy. We couldn't go side by side much, but the roads were
  still really nice with barely a car on them. We then descended down towards
  Easter Fern having climbed to around 600ft. The views were quite amazing
  looking over the hills and loch. The roads down were also super quick, we hit
  around 60kph or more.

  that sold random, and quite quaint items. It wasn't expensive either. This was
  one regret from passing through Scotland. As a child spending holidays up
  there seeing the family, we'd often go to all sorts of amazing tea houses. On
  our trip we certainly passed a few, so based in castle's (like Dunrobin) but
  we didn't really have the time to stop (and I don't think the guys were
  totally sold on the idea). But after the experience of the coffee shop in
  Argay I think we all wished we had done a few more tea rooms (so much so that
  we spent a fair bit of time in a tea room in Thurso).

  The castle took quite a while to reach. The road approaching it was very
  scenic, although seemed to take ages to cycle up, as did the long driveway in
  the castle grounds. It was was quite amazing to see and stay in although still
  not one of my favourites. We put our bikes in the open, but sheltered storage
  and walked around the grounds. Inside it was very grand, with room after room
  it was easy to get lost inside. The drying room was a bit of a disappointment,
  not being very hot, and also stacked full of soaking kayaking gear. It was a
  long way from the nearest pub which was a shame, so we were forced to stay in
  for the night.
