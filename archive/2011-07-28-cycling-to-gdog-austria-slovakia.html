  >Germany was such a great experience, I had high hopes for Austria given their
  similarities. The cycle path from Passau to Vienna is the most popular part so
  a great place to meet other cycle tourers. The Danube trail goes right through
  Vienna where I decided to take a long rest break and repair/replace broken and
  lost items. After Austria I entered Slovakia, staying at Bratislava before
  moving on to Hungary.

<h3>Passau to Vienna</h3>

  >The trip across to Vienna was done over four days, all of which I camped out
  each night. Once away from the busy surrounding roads of Passau the cycle path
  was typically a small, well-tarmacked road but only inhabited by cyclists (and
  plenty of them, many of which were crazy/noisy Italians). For the most part it
  ran right alongside the Danube as it wound through a gorge. This created one
  of the best cycling days of the trip so far, and was probably the best route
  I've even been on. Relaxing, scenic, enjoyable and plenty of places to sit out
  and have a cold beer in the sun. During the first couple of days I met two
  German boys who were cycling from Munich to Belgrade during Summer break. I
  can't remember what I was doing at 16 but it certainly wasn't that
  adventurous!

  >The third and fourth day towards Vienna couldn't quite compete with the first
  day, especially as by this point it had clouded over and was often raining.
  The third day from Grein to Krems did pass through some old medieval towns
  with "toll" castles, whereby each kingdom would charge river users a toll as
  they sailed down. These town seemed to largely be populated by coach loads of
  Americans, and the cobbled streets weren't appreciated when riding on the
  bike.

<h3>Czechs + Slovovice</h3>
<p>

  >At the end of the third day I arrived at a virtually empty campsite except
  for myself and three Czech guys. They were very friendly and thankfully spoke
  very good English as I'm a little rusty with my Czech. They were; Martin, a
  programmer and from the sound of things quite a talented one; Tom, a contract
  designer, again sounding very good at what he does; and finally
  <a href="http://www.chvila.com" target="_blank">Radovan</a>, "the best" (as he
  put it) or one of the best wedding photographers in the Czech Republic (but he
  doesn't travel far, so if you have a wedding it needs to be near his house).
  They introduced me to their home-made slivovice (49% alcohol) they were
  carrying around with them in re-used plastic bottles. I was told it would fix
  any stomach issues and keep me strong. Unfortunately after a long night of
  drinking, it had quite the opposite effect so my fourth day was a rather slow
  cycle in the pouring rain. I cycled with the Czech guys for the day, parting
  ways in Vienna.

<h3>Vienna</h3>

  >Arriving in large cities can often be a pain, but Vienna was surprisingly
  pleasant as the Danube runs through the heart of it with a cycle path on both
  sides. During my three night stay I was hugely impressed by the city. It oozes
  class and romance, with trendy bars and restaurants hidden down virtually
  every street. The architecture ranges from Roman to modern making a nice mix
  of old and new. Add in plenty of museum and opera and it's a very trendy, if a
  little expensive, place to live. It does have its more "earthy" areas,
  concrete playgrounds covered in graffiti, as I discovered when traipsing
  around the city trying to find a number of shops to aid in my repairs. My tent
  has developed a couple of pin-hole holes, so I needed silicon sealer. I had no
  literature beyond Budapest (ie where the route was, campsites, places to eat
  etc...) which was making me nervous, and I had lost my cycling glasses.
  Luckily I found everything I needed, even a guide book in English (my others
  are in German!) although I did feel a little like J.R. Hartley walking around
  all the book shops asking for a specific edition. And lastly some new cycling
  glasses. Unable to find any budget pairs in Vienna I opted for a pair of
  Oakley M-Frames costing me small fortune, but they should allow me to cycle
  faster (or so I tell myself).

<h3>Sachertorte</h3>

  >Having quite a sweet tooth, I couldn't pass up the opportunity of trying some
  Sachertorte in Vienna, a chocolate cake made famous by Franz Sacher in the
  1800's. Many places sell variations (the original recipe is apparently a
  secret) but I opted to try the original at the Sacher Hotel. At Â£11 it's the
  most expensive hot chocolate (with rum) and cake I've bought to date, but it
  was worth it. I made sure I took my time and enjoyed being sat in a 5-star
  hotel's cafe.

<h3>Slovakia</h3>

  >Vienna and Bratislava are the closest two capitals in the world. The cycle
  between the two was around 70km. It started off promisingly, but became rather
  boring with most places closed, so no lunch. Along the way I bumped into two
  American brothers; Daniel, a physical trainer and marathon runner (to keep in
  shape he ran every morning for an hour before cycling!); and Matt who had just
  graduated with a masters in history. They were over from Long Beach,
  California cycling Passau to Budapest. A relative had passed away and one of
  his dying wishes was that they cycle part of the Danube. So they jumped on to
  a flight to Munich, bought some bikes there then made their way over to
  Passau. They may not be doing as much distance as me, but it's still a long
  way to come and very adventurous thing to do. We joined forces and would be my
  cycling partners for the next three days. It was great to have the company and
  some intelligent conversation as cycling through Slovakia was quite boring. I
  arrived in Bratislava. A mixture of old, new and buildings that represented
  poorer times. It wasn't the prettiest city, but the people were very friendly
  and most could speak fairly good English. I don't think it'll be somewhere
  I'll revisit though.
