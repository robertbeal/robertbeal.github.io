<p>The first stage has taken me into (including England god damn it!) 13 countries at a total distance of 3700km, and
    after going to the F1 in Hungary, buying some Oakley's (to replace my lost glasses) and blowing £180 in a strip
    joint in Romania... a slightly depleted budget. Having said that, the F1 was an amazing experience, my new Oakley
    sunglasses led me to buy two more pairs and get them free, and the strip joint will be a memory I won't be
    forgetting.</p><a name='more'></a>

                    width="160" height="240" /></a>Favourite Country</strong> - Germany, for its cycle paths, beer,
        food, culture, well preserved cities and crazy/friendly people.</li>
    <li><strong>Least Favourite Country</strong> - Hungary/Romania. Both because of their awful roads (Hungary more so)
        and the people were a little moody in the cities. Days in Romania were hot and often quite a slog.</li>
    <li><strong>Favourite Cities</strong> - Luxembourg comes out top. It's hard to explain why, but at the time the
        old-town area was quite amazing to relax and enjoy. Definitely somewhere I could live. Istanbul and Vienna are
        very different but on a par. Belgrade impressed me hugely (not just because of the beautiful women) as did
        Regensburg, both pushing Budapest off the top list.</li>

                    width="160" height="240" /></a>Worst Day</strong> - Romania. The final day into Constanta. Cobbled
        roads (5km worth), trucks, 3 line highway. Nasty!</li>

    <li><strong>Average Day</strong> - 93km</li>
    <li><strong>Top Speed</strong> - 65kmh</li>

        out free watermelons, tomatoes and peppers), and kids.</li>
    <li><strong>Most Beautiful Women</strong> - Serbia (runner-up Romania)</li>
    <li><strong>Most Aggressive Dogs</strong> - Serbia (runner-up Romania)</li>
    <li><strong>Budget Blown</strong> - £3,500! (including my flight to Japan)</li>
