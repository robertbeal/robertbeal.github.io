  >Entering Serbia was easy, and took only a couple of minutes at the border
  control. At first I was surrounded by farms, and relatively poor villages but
  as I got closer to Novi Sad the surroundings slowly became wealthier and roads
  busier. I had left at 1100 and arrived by 1400 so had cycled in the heat of
  the day... around 32C. It wasn't very pleasant, especially as there were
  hills. I told myself I wouldn't do it again (how little I knew!).

<h3>Novi Sad</h3>

  >Arriving in Novi Sad, I bumped into two English guys (fresh out of
  university), ("Safety") Mark and Ed, that I had bumped into briefly in Vienna.
  Unfortunately they were leaving Vienna as I arrived, so I had thought it was
  company lost. As fortune would have it they had taken a couple of extra days
  rest around Budapest so I managed to catch them. They were cycling a very
  similar route, although started on the Rhein in Holland and were going to
  Constanta in Romania, whereas I would eventually head South into Bulgaria and
  then Turkey. It was still a chance to cycle with some company so I joined
  forces with them.
</p>
<p>
  My one night in Novi Sad was spent enjoying the town, going out to bars, clubs
  and staring in amazement at how beautiful the majority of the women are. We
  walked up to the [wiki]Petrovaradin Fortress[/wiki] on the other side of the
  river. It dates back as far as Roman times but was since been rebuilt and
  modified and now is full of bars, clubs and restaurants all done in a way that
  doesn't ruin or retract from the fortress itself. It is also home of the Exit
  festival. A great place to visit and very lively, highly recommended if you're
  in the area.

<h3>Intense Heat</h3>

  >The next day we left Novi Sad to cycle to Belgrade. Having stayed out until
  after 0300, we didn't start cycling until 1330. This meant once again cycling
  through the heat of the day, which this time was 34C. After about 10km we hit
  a hill (an 8% one!) that lasted around 6km. This took us around 30-40 minutes
  to climb but in the process we were drenched in sweat and quite exhausted from
  the heat. I could have jumped in a swimming pool and not have been much
  wetter. Once over the hill though we had a 6km descent which was quite a
  relief. We didn't have time for lunch as we had set off so late, so the day
  was spent buying fruit from the fruit stalls that line the roads, cans of coke
  and ice creams. Serbia grows the most awesome peaches (watermelons I preferred
  in Romania). In the end it was a fairly pleasant day. We arrived at Belgrade
  by 2000 just as it was getting dark. Tomorrow would be 36C(!) but thankfully
  it was a rest day!
</p>
<h3>Belgrade</h3>

  >Given the 36C heat it was hard to do much on our rest day in Belgrade. We did
  walk to the fortress up on the hill which had great views across the city
  looking down onto the river. But most of our time was spent jumping to and
  from shaded areas, or sat drinking ice-cold drinks under a parasol. Belgrade
  had a nice feel to it and a huge bar (more so than club) culture. Trendy bars
  line some of the back streets and both banks of the river (a tributary of the
  Danube) that cuts through Belgrade. Drinks were fairly cheap at around £1.50 a
  pint. Unfortunately our rest day was a Monday, so it wasn't the best night of
  the week to go out, but there was still a good vibe until midnight. The main
  high street is pedestrianised and worth a visit. It has a similar feel to
  something like the Ramblas in Barcelona, packed full of people, families,
  entertainers and lined with cafe's and restaurants, with people walking up and
  down it even during weekdays until near midnight.
</p>
<h3>Leaving Belgrade</h3>

  >The roads into Belgrade had been fairly pleasant. It was quite the opposite
  for leaving. The first 20km was spent in heavy traffic, which was bearable
  when the road was dual carriageway (as the traffic uses the other lane to
  overtake you), but became much harder when it was single lane as lorries,
  buses and cars would all squeeze by. Things didn't get much better after
  leaving Belgrade. We experienced our first dog attack. Cycling near a factory,
  six dogs bolted across a grass verge, over a ditch and into the road barking
  at us. They were fairly aggresive and at first just barked at us as we went by
  at 20kmh, but eventually one made a move, biting into my right pannier. I
  carried on pedalling and dragged it along a bit before it let go. After that
  experience we armed ourselves with sticks, stones and mace to fend off any
  future threats.
</p>
<h3>Road Kill</h3>
<p>
  One common feature of Serbia is the amount of road-kill at the side of the
  roads. Mostly dogs, we have seen around ten since entering Serbia, some
  flattened like pancakes as if it were something from a cartoon. Today however
  was different as we saw our first human body at the side of the road. Unsure
  of what we had just seen, we circled back and passed by a woman lying in the
  ditch at the side of the road. A car saw us doing so, and also noticed the
  body. We stopped a little further on unsure what to do, but by this time the
  car made a u-turn and headed back to inform someone so we decided to just keep
  going given it was being delt with. We don't think she was dead, probably
  homeless and drunk, but couldn't be sure. The road was in a fairly remote area
  and a random place to see a body so the whole experience was a bit
  odd/haunting. We decided not to get a photo.

<h3>Pozaverac</h3>

  >Our final stop before entering the Danube gorge was Pozeravac, a small town
  that left us feeling we were in no-man's land. The hostel was good though at
  €9 we basically had an apartment to ourselves, with kitchen, fridge, sofa,
  dinner table and ensuite. The town did actually have quite a bit of night life
  but by midnight we decided to head back to get plenty of sleep for the gorge
  the next day.
</p>
<h3>The Gorge</h3>
<p>
  The next two days that followed were the best cycling of the trip so far. We
  were now deep into the Serbian countryside, passing through a mixture of
  either very poor or quite wealthy areas. We got the most "hello's" and
  attention in the poorer parts, usually from kids just wanting some attention.
  While not great cycling due to the bumpy roads, it was fascinating travelling.
  At one point, upon stopping to check the map, we were invited to share
  watermelon at a house. We sat in a garden eating our way through a couple of
  watermelons chatting to Milan, an out of work graduate with a degree in
  computing. As we were told on numerous occassions no one has a job in Serbia,
  so they just party. While this was partly true it was clear to see Milan was
  frustrated being an educated man, but unable to find work.

  >For the past few days we had been quite a distance from the Danube. We
  eventually rejoined it and the route from Ram all the way to Sip (where we
  crossed to Romania) was the best cycling of the trip so far (topping Passau to
  Vienna). Around 100km of cycling through a gorge on a road, which sometimes
  had fast traffic, but for the most part was fast, smooth and relatively empty.
  Every time we saw something amazing we'd start imitating the Double Rainbow
  (hilarious clip on Youtube) by getting over excited.. There were a number of
  tunnels (that aren't lit) which while a little dangerous were really exciting
  and I'm glad we went through (rather than being on the tunnel-less Romanian
  side). The longest was around 300m which seemed to last ages but my IQ Cyo
  dynamo light ensured I could see everything in front of me. On the downhills
  we all managed over 65kmh which was the fastest yet for all of us. Definitely
  somewhere I would cycle again.

  >Eventually we arrived at Sip to cross the border into Romania. Serbia had
  been a great experience. The people were very friendly and we constantly got
  honks of encouragement from passing cars. The women are very beautiful and
  fairly fascinated by western Europeans given how closed a country Serbia has
  been in the past. At no point did we feel threatened or in danger, the dogs
  were the biggest threat, but more of a nuisance than a danger. It had been a
  great experience and one I will hopefully relive again.
