  ><strong>4th August 2010</strong> - We set off a little earlier today as Glen
  Coe hostel didn't serve breakfast. We cycled into Glen Coe but didn't find
  much in the way of breakfast, so had to make do with a shop and sitting
  outside on the kerb. Glen Coe as a town was a little disappointing and felt
  empty, nothing like what I had thought it would be like. We cycled around the
  lochs there, taking photos as we went, and pushed on up to Fort William to
  meet my uncle.
</p>
<p>
  The road into Fort William was classified an A road, but was a typical city B
  road in England, meaning we had to go in single file the whole way. We made
  good time though as the roads allowed us to push a bit faster. I led most of
  the first 30km to ensure we'd meet my uncle on time. Fort William was another
  disappointing town. We didn't see much of it, the pedestrianised high street
  was nice, but I didn't like the ring road and business park around it. We met
  my uncle for around an hour over a coffee and got back on our way. Today was
  the shortest route of the whole trip so we were planning to arrive at our
  hostel nice an early.

  >We cycled around Loch Lochy and stopped every so often to go down closer to
  the loch and take photos. We managed to find a swing overhanging the loch. Al
  was brave enough to swing out over the loch, although I didn't fancy putting
  my weight on it. The roads around the loch were nice, although there were
  always passing cars so we had to go in single file. This made the latter part
  of the trip a lot less sociable and was common throughout Scotland (and one of
  the reasons I preferred England).

  >As we arrived at the bottom tip of Loch Ness it started to down pour very
  heavily. We picked up some food at a local store, and stood under the trees
  until it eased. Having got within 5-10mins of the hostel we didn't want to
  have to dry our kit over night. We were running early too, so had time to
  spare. In fact so early when we got to the hostel it hadn't opened yet, so we
  made use of the time by cleaning the bikes.
</p>
<p>
  Loch Ness hostel was ok, everyone got a single room, which was nice but at the
  same time I missed not being able to talk to the other guys as I could at
  other LEJOG hostels. The hostel didn't have much around it apart from the
  loch. We weren't really in the mood for a walk around the loch though, so sat
  inside catching up with journal entries, and playing cards. We had for the
  first time arrived at a hostel before 17:00, and ironically it was one of the
  hostels that had the least to do around it.
