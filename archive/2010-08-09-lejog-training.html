  Leading up to our LEJOG trip we've been training so that there aren't any
  surprises on the trip. With a World Cup on, Wimbledon, occasional F1 Grand
  Prix's, bad English weather, and general commitments it's been tricky making
  the time, especially to train as a trio. But we have still got in quite a few
  runs.<br /><br />Because of this we started our training mid April, and
  focused on making the most of the May bank holidays for back-to-back training.
  Here's a break down of the runs we've done. In between the below runs done at
  the weekends, I (and typically the others) also cycle to work during the week.
  32km round trip, but not every day so that I can rest for a big weekend run.

<ul>
  <li>Week 1 - 60km</li>
  <li>Week 3 - 70km</li>
  <li>Week 5 - 90km</li>
  <li>Week 7 - 50km / 110km</li>
  <li>Week 9 - 135km</li>
  <li>Week 10 - 140km</li>
  <li>Week 11 - 110km / 100km</li>
  <li>Week 12 - 110km</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The furthest we reached was a 140km. Not too bad, our longest day is 165km. I
  had planned for us to do a 155km training run, but we didn't manage it. Given
  our typical day is around 110km, we've done plenty at that distance, although
  with not quite as much ascent.
</p>
<h3>Lessons Learnt</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Food / Breaks</strong> - A few of a runs we would have a relatively
  quick lunch, maybe 20mins. I found it quite beneficial to up the break to 1
  hour, and have a decent amount of food. This rested the legs properly, and
  gave me a belly full of energy to do the second half of the day with. Plus
  it's a lot more enjoyable and social, especially if sat in a nice pub beer
  garden.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Water</strong> - We didn't get the water quite right on a few runs on
  a few of the hotter days (30C+). The body is very bad at letting you know when
  you need fluids, and often tells you far too late. I typically try to drink a
  whole bike bottle (750ml) in around 25-30km. I carry 2 on the bike, and a
  spare in my bag. We then just buy top-ups whenever we have the opportunity.
  It's even more important coming up to 1pm, as 1-4pm is when it's usually
  hottest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Rain</strong> - after a couple of training runs in heavy rain we
  decided to make a few changes. We'd take legging to keep the legs warmer.
  You'll still get wet, but the combination of rain + wind made it hard to keep
  the legs warm, especially when taking breaks. Leggings don't completely solve
  the problem, but they reduce it, and are light and easy to carry. Overshoes
  are another consideration although we've yet to make the final decision. Wet
  feet for 6+ hours is not a good thing, and something overshoes would help
  reduce, but at the cost of taking up a fair big of packing space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pace</strong> - It wasn't until the later runs that we began to focus
  on our pace more. In the earlier runs, feeling fresh, we'd go out flying for
  the first half, and pay the price the second half. It wasn't enjoyable, and as
  we all agreed we didn't want to o LEJOG enjoying the first half of each day,
  and not the second.
