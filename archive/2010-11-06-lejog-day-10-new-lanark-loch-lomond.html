  ><strong>2nd August 2010</strong> - After such a draining cycle the day before
  we had a lie-in and didn't leave until around 10:30. In retrospect we should
  have still left around 09:00, leaving so late meant we still arrived at our
  destination late. We cycled clockwise around the outskirts of Glasgow, which
  to start was quite pleasant. The roads weren't great though, something we
  experienced throughout most of Scotland, and we got our first puncture of the
  LEJOG trip after over 1000km of cycling. It was Daryl (we had to fix it in the
  rain), and it wasn't his last of the day.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually we cut into Glasgow to head towards the Erskine bridge. This was
  where the trip got a nasty. We passed through some fairly unpleasant areas
  with busy roads, poor tarmac, glass on the road, and generally not the nicest
  areas in terms of substance. As we got closer to the Erskine bridge Daryl got
  another puncture. We promptly stopped and fixed it, only for him to get a 3rd
  puncture crossing the bridge. We had gone through two fresh inner tubes, and
  Darly's rear tyre wasn't looking in very good condition. The Erskine bridge
  was actually quite easy to cross. They've dedicated a whole lane for bikes,
  and you have a barrier between you and the cars.

  />Luckily we were close to Dumbarton which had a Halfords. We had to stop to
  ask for directions. Asking a local young scallie, he directed us via KFC and
  Asda, brilliant!. We bought Daryl a new tyre, and got it all fitted. We also
  popped into Asda to pick up dinner as we were within 10km of the hostel. Once
  across the bridge, there's a cycle path that can be followed. It runs along
  the canals, and goes virtually all the way to Loch Lomond hostel. I hadn't
  originally planned it, but it was far better than being anywhere near the A82.
  The tarmac was brand new too, and we made some good time. Some of the route
  did turn into a little bit of a dirt track, but we managed on our bikes.

  >We arrived at the hostel around 19:00. It was one of the grander ones of the
  whole trip, and worth staying at. While it was great seeing a lot of the
  larger hostels, I didn't find them as nice as some of the smaller ones like
  Boscastle and All Stretton. However, Loch Lomond wasn't too bad. It would have
  been nicer to have got there a little earlier and sat in the grounds, although
  with the midgies out I don't think we would have lasted long. They seemed to
  develop a taste for Daryl though which was handy as I just needed to stand
  near him, and they'd go for him rather than me.

<p>
  We got in and cooked a quick pasta dinner. Daryl failed to understand the
  "left or right" game Al and I play when dividing up food. One person splits
  the food, hands behind his back, and the other person picks left or right. So
  it's largely chance, but with a few mind games involved. Daryl on the other
  hand would split the food and just eat it, and as chance would have it, the
  part he ate would always be the largest.
