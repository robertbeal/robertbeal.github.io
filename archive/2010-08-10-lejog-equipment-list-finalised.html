pump.<br /><br />In the below picks, all descriptions run from left to right.<br /><br /><a

<h3>Additions</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    Seal Skinz Socks - instead of taking overshoes, these socks are a reasonable
    replacement. They won't keep you as dry, they will eventually get soaked,
    but your feet stay warm. They take up a lot less space than over shoes.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Ointment - a small, pocket size tin of XXX, for any skin grazes, rubbing
    etc... Generally handy stuff to have
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Hand/Body wipes - in case we need to get oily and clean the bike. Or
    especially for lunch stops. I find wiping away all the sweat and dried salt
    crystals from the skin important in stopping rubbing and damaged skin.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Cable ties - just a few of the wire cable ties, handy to have given how
    little weight and space they take up.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Vaseline - replacement for the lipsil. Mainly because I can put it up my
    nose to reduce hay-fever. The tin, pocket size version you often see girls
    carrying around.
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Dropped</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    Over shoes - too heavy and bulky to pack. Replace by the seal skin socks.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>Lipsil - as mentioned, replace by vaseline.</li>
  <br />
  <li>
    SLR - I had originally wanted to take my digital SLR. Given we won't always
    be stopping to take photos, and most photos will either beÂ  of us, or
    landscapes I thought my compact camera will be a good enough substitute. I
    would still like to take my SLR but the size and weight of it make it
    virtually impossible to do so with the luggage I have.
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Fully Loaded</h2>
<br />This is what my and my brother's bikes looked like fully loaded with the
Topeak bags on...<br /><br /><a

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<br />This part comes after having done the trip. There were a few things we
could have done with and without listed below.<br />
<h3>Most Valuable Items</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    Bum cream (as we called it) - until you fully condition it's very handy to
    have.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Decent, breathable, waterproof jacket - two of us had one, but one member
    didn't and it showed.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Sunblock - it wasn't hugely effective, but it did work to an extent. When
    spending 7-10 hours in the sun you have to protect your skin.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Hand/body wipes - excellent for cleaning off after fixing a puncture, or
    wiping away salt around the face at lunch time.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Cable ties - generally handy, in our cases used to stop one of the locks
    unwinding while riding.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Ointment - I took a small tin, which proved helpful in the evening for
    healing any saddle rubbed areas.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Seal skinz socks - in Scotland, and also when it rained these were great.
    Just helped keep our feet warmer and better protected. They're a pain to dry
    though.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>Chain lube - we used this every other day, it was needed.</li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Could Have Done Without</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>Razor - take a disposable one instead, I used mine only once.</li>
  <br />
  <li>3 pumps - we only used 1.</li>
  <br />
  <li>2 locks - we would have been fine with 1.</li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Washing up liquid - used to clean our bottles. All hostels supply this
    anyway.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>Insect repellent - wasn't really needed, and we didn't use it.</li>
  <br />
  <li>
    50ml shampoo per person. We took 100ml, so we only used half of what we
    took.
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Could Have Done With</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <br />
  <li>
    12 Toothpicks - for cleaning bikes and mainly chains. Odds sticks we found
    sort of did the trick. Some toothpicks are light and small though.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Degreaser - we didn't take this, but I wish we had for cleaning the gunk off
    the chain.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Brake pad blocks - a spare set is worth carrying. Cornwall, Devon and the
    rain caused us to burn through a fresh set.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Foldable fork - for eating, given how many pasta meals we ate for lunch that
    didn't come with one.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Attachable lights - firstly easily attachable ones, but ones that will
    somehow attach when you have your rain covers over your bags.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Sweatproof sunblock - the waterproof stuff just sweats out as you cycle so
    wasn't very effective.
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    2 pairs of underwear - taking a single pair for the evening was a bit of a
    pain. Washing them meant going commando for an evening.
  </li>
  <br />
</ul>
