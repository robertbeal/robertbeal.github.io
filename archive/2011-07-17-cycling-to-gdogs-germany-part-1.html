  >Having quickly passed through France, Belgium and Luxembourg, Germany was the
  next country for me to cross. In terms of pure road cycling it's not the most
  pleasant experience. The roads connecting towns are fast, busy and often have
  no hard shoulder (which I had become accustomed to in France). German drivers
  just seem to want to get from A to B as quickly and as efficiently (in true
  German style) as possible. The speed and how close they passed made me a
  little nervous.

<h3>Cycle Paths</h3>

  >However, I soon discovered a huge cycle network that links up the whole
  country. Why go in the roads when there are cycle paths everywhere. The more
  of Germany I passed through the more I realised what a large cycle culture it
  has. Around many cities and along the rivers there are cycle paths, all
  clearly marked (with distances) and sign posted. It makes for a great cycle
  experience as you're often well away from the traffic. On occasion the cycle
  path becomes a dirt track, or the tarmac is bumpy, but in general it's the
  most impressive cycle network arguably in the world. You can easily cross the
  country in multiple directions just by using cycle paths. It puts to shame the
  cycle infrastructure we have in the UK.

<h3>Trier</h3>

  >My first stop was the oldest city in Germany, Trier. Unfortunately I stayed
  in a rather boring hotel, a long way from anything interesting so there were
  no real stories to tell. Cycling through one of the main wine regions in
  Germany along the river Moselle was excellent though. It wasn't until my next
  hostel near Mainz that I finally started to meet people of interest.
</p>
<h3>Mainz</h3>
<p>
  The first guy I met was a builder who couldn't speak much English (he was
  Czech) so I just watched his evening routine at the hostel. After a 12 hour
  day working on a building site he would come back, check Facebook while
  listening to German pop music, eat a doner kebab, neck a beer then go to bed.
  A truly hard lifestyle. I later found out the hostel is commonly used for
  builders to stay at while they work in Mainz. Guys will come from the Baltic
  states to earn a little more money than they would at home.

  >Earlier the Russian hostel owner, Andre, invited me for tea, so we sat
  outside talking about London as his sister was to visit soon. At one point he
  asked me to follow him and went down into a dark concrete basement. I followed
  innocently, but in the back of my mind was thinking of Pulp Fiction. I didn't
  really want a gimp ball strapped in my mouth, or for the brothers to get
  medieval on my ass yet I still followed. Fortunately he just wanted to show me
  the generator he had powering the building and providing the hot water. He was
  genuinely quite proud of it. I used my
  <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4homes/on-tv/grand-designs/" target="_blank"
    >Grand Designs</a
  >
  knowledge to talk to him about energy efficient homes. Later in the evening I
  told him I had cycled around Mainz, so not actually been through it. He
  insisted I see it and said he would drive me there, but only if I help him
  pick up a bed in his van on the way. So I did, it was all a bit random. I also
  bumped into my first proper tourers. A retired Australian couple, ironically
  from Perth and they used to be software developers. So we had plenty to talk
  about and compare notes on.

<h3>Wurzburg</h3>
<p>

  >The next day I continued on my way to Wurzburg. Unable to find a suitable
  stealth camping spot, I opted for a campsite. I pitched my tent next to a guy
  called Fritz. He was a 60-something year old German guy who was kayacking
  along the river, 30km each day. He couldn't speak English but we managed to
  communicate, worse case by me drawing really bad diagrams in my notepad. He
  even offered me a beer and some tobacco if I had a pipe (God knows why he
  thought I might have a pipe). I left him sat on his little camping stool,
  drinking beer and smoking his pipe to go and have some dinner. When I came
  back 3 hours later he was still sat in exactly the same position smiling
  happily away.

  >Getting closer to Wurzburg I befriended a German guy called Christian whilst
  cycling along. He was out cycling for the weekend from Frankfurt. We decided
  to stick together and he was kind enough to alter his route and follow me to
  Wurzburg. It was nice to have some company, although the pace was a lot slower
  than I'd normally do. Halfway through the day I had GPS issues (it wouldn't
  update!), possibly due to it getting cooked in the 30C heat. The GPS is ok
  now, but it's a constant worry. In some of the countries later in my trip
  where there isn't a cycle path to follow, I'll be lost without it.
</p>
<p>
  I rested up in Wurzburg, a small city in Bavaria for 2 days. A quiet place,
  with a few things to do, but in all honestly I was just glad to do nothing,
  watch the F1 and sleep a lot. I did make a point of sampling the local wine,
  and trying quite a few beers. The best thing about beer drinking in Germany,
  is that there's always at least 3 beers on the menu that I've not seen before
  in each town, which means I have to try them.
