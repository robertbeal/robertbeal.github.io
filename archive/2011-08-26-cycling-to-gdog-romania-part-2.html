  >Having left Romania for Bulgaria, we spent a rest day in Ruse. The contrast
  between the Romanian town, Guirgui, and Bulgarian town, Ruse, is huge despite
  them being a bridge apart. Ruse had a beautiful town centre filled with water
  fountains, a town hall, opera, and plenty of cafe's and bars to sit outside in
  the evening. The first part of our rest day was spent lying in bed. Once up we
  found Planet Food, a coffee shop near the centre and bought the equivalent of
  two meals per person (it got a look of shock from the waitress).

<h3>Chilling In Ruse</h3>

  >Given the 35C heat we didn't last very long walking around in the middle of
  the day. Instead we retreated back to our air-conditioned hotel (€39 between
  the three of us per night) and watched some South Park. Once it had started to
  cool down we went back out to eat and drink at the huge number of cafe's that
  line the pedestrianised high street. Bulgaria felt a lot nicer compared to
  it's equivalent on the other side of the river, the only difficultly was the
  Cyrillic characters making it a nightmare to read menu's (in kebab shops!).
  Unfortunately, being a Tuesday the night-life didn't extend very far, so we
  had a few beers and went to bed just after midnight.

<h3>Cycling Bulgaria</h3>

  >The next day we set off at our earliest time yet (as a group), 1000. The
  roads out of Ruse weren't very pleasant as we had to pass the bridge (ie
  border crossing), so had plenty of lorries whizzing passed us along a dual
  carriageway. Once about 50km away from Ruse the countryside became more
  interesting (but also more hilly) and roads more bearable. In terms of metres
  climbed in a day it was one of the most for the whole stage, and the constant
  up and down (few flats) became frustrating. It wasn't the best touring route,
  but in terms of pure speed and road cycling it was very good. Before we knew
  it we had reached Silistra (another nice looking Bulgarian town, although not
  as nice as Ruse) and were at the border crossing ready to re-enter Romania.
</p>
<h3>Romania Take Two</h3>
<p>
  Entering Romania the second time was a lot better. The road from Silistra lead
  directly to the coast so the surrounding area was a lot more affluent. We
  encountered our first hills in Romania through vineyards and the typical
  villages we had passed through on our first entry.

  >We wild camped near the Danube close to the last point we'd see it. The
  Danube turns north whereas we continued east to Constanta. It's fairly easy to
  find wild camping spots in Romania. Our spot was perfect, a matter of 5 metres
  from the Danube, although we were engulfed by dozens or mosquitoes trying to
  get through the insect mesh on our tents. Mark despite his thin frame was the
  juiciest to the mosquitoes and come the morning he'd usually wake up with a
  constellation of bites across his back. Amazingly, given this was the most
  mosquitoes we'd seen, he ended up with only the odd bite.
</p>
<h3>The Final Day</h3>
<p>
  The last day was unfortunately not very pleasant. At 120km it was fairly long
  in the 34C heat. We encountered around 5km of cobbled streets through
  villages. The final 30km of the trip was spent sharing the road with large
  lorries taking materials to construction sites, and then finally a 6 lane
  highway into Constanta. It was a real grind and I was glad to have the company
  of Mark and Ed.
</p>
<h3>Addicted To Coke</h3>
<p>
  Over the past two weeks, under the influence of Mark and Ed we've all become
  addicted to Coca Cola. Every cycle stop is followed by a can of coke, and a
  (soggy) cornetto. At the moment given we may stop two or three times, I'm
  going through around a litre of coke a day. Not the healthiest thing to drink,
  or particularly good for my teeth but it's so readily available, in a few
  cases more so than bottled water!
</p>
<h3>Constanta</h3>

  >Reaching Constanta was a bit of an anti-climax. It's is not the picturesque
  town on the sea I had envisaged. On our first full day at the beach we were
  already talking about how we wished we had gone to the Mediterranean Sea
  instead of the Black Sea (a poor man's Med, which did fit as we were in
  Romania). The beaches are nice but nothing special, usually covered in sand
  with broken shells and rubbish/cigarette butts all over the place. A descent
  amount of topless bathing though which was encouraging to see. Constanta has
  some good bars in the old town and restaurants where £12 will get you a first
  class, large meal. A beer usually costs around £1.50 a pint (not quite as
  cheap as the £0.75 a pint we were used to in the villages). There is also
  Mamaia (a few kilometres north of the old town) where most of the hotels and
  clubs reside (and a water park which was good fun!) and prices double or even
  triple. The clubs were quite amazing and glamorous to look at, where virtually
  every girl was stunning. There was a distinct lack of character though and
  they were surprisingly boring. A case of image over substance, people would
  just stand around and look "cool". At one point our group was escorted from
  the dance floor for having too much fun (seriously) and told to stand
  elsewhere.
