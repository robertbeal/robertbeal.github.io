  >While I really like my Genesis Croix De Fer I am left frustrated by it. A
  good bike but not quite perfect. There are a few simple changes in the
  specification Genesis could have made to push it that little bit closer to
  being a perfect bike. I use mine as a road bike, on odd trails and cross
  country, and also as a tourer. So it gets varied use, yet under all of those
  uses it's not quite right. For now I plan on using all of the components to
  death, but at the first chance I will be changing the set-up.

<h3>Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Weight</strong> - this is probably the main thing that bothers me.
    The stock bike (when I weighed it) was 11.8kg. With touring modifications it
    weighs 13.0kg (+ new saddle, + mudguards, + rack). Don't get me wrong, I
    know it's a steel frame, which I do really like. It's just frustrating that
    for £1100 there are plenty of 10-11kg (and less) equivalent bikes (steel
    included) out there with impressive specifications. If the Croix De Fer
    weighed 11kg I'd be happy, 11.8kg is just pushing a bit heavy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gearing</strong> - for touring, as a cross bike, or even on steep
    roads the gearing isn't ideal. The compact 50/34T chainset is pretty
    standard, and saves on weight. The 12-25T cassette could have a slightly
    better range. 12-32T would be much better, and a long cage rear mech to go
    with it. I know the ratios will have bigger jumps, but I'd rather that than
    burning legs. It'd certainly make those 30% roads, or steep muddy banks, or
    loaded touring much easier and more enjoyable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tyres</strong> - the stock tyres are rubbish. On tarmac (which they
    aren't suited to) they're noisy, and off-road they puncture far too easily.
    I originally opted for Schwalbe Marathon 32C tyres, but have since switched
    to Schwalbe Marathon Supreme 28C tyres saving me 600g in weight at £14 extra
    cost.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Saddle</strong> - the stock saddle isn't very comfortable at all,
    but is quite light. I replaced mine, and from reading around forums a lot of
    people have done so too. The Brooks B17 replacement is a great saddle,
    although isn't the most sleek/fastest looking. I think it's a love/hate
    relationship... time will tell.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rack</strong> - the Madison Ridge rack is great value, cheap and
    lightweight. It is however a good 4 inches wider than a standard rack. In
    busy cities I just prefer to be as narrow as possible so that I don't get
    squeezed and I generally have a better sense of the bike when it is
    narrower. Annoyingly I think quite a few standard racks would actually be
    able to fit despite having disc brakes.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes I'd Like To See</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A lighter bike in general. I know this is a big ask as it's a steel bike. In
    fact 11.8kg is pretty good already. Maybe a Reynolds 853 frame and lighter
    tyres would shave 500g off. If they got it down to 11kg it would be a near
    perfect bike.
  </li>
  <li>
    Better gearing. The ratios are the same as I had on my Boardman Carbon bike,
    yet the Croix De Fer weighs 3kg more! A long cage rear mech and an 11-32T
    cassette would be perfect instead of the stock Shimano 105 short cage mech
    and 12-25T cassette. I spent £30 buying an 11-28T cassette which is the
    largest I can go without needing a long cage mech, or longer chain. Not a
    perfect solution, but cheaper than replacing a mech, chain, or chainset. A
    triple front chainset would have been more suitable, such as a Shimano Deore
    26/36/48T.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rear disc brake mount on the chainstay. This would solve the rack issues,
    meaning I could mount any standard rack. Quite a number of frame builders
    have already opted for this.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes I Should Have Made</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A different rack. I'm sure I could have gone to a few cycle shops to see if
    a standard rack would fit. This in turn would make the bike with panniers on
    narrower and more aerodynamic. For now I'm sticking with my Madison Ridge
    rack as I don't want to incur more cost and as mentioned it's light and good
    value, just wider than I would like.
  </li>
</ul>
