<p>
  I'm planning on going away travelling for around 6 months (maybe more, maybe
  less, I'm not sure yet). During this time I obviously plan on enjoying the
  places I'll be in, but I do plan on having some down time to write blog posts,
  process photos, and also do some development. It'll hopefully be an
  enlightening time to try out some ideas and also improve my programming
  skills.

<h3>About My Travels</h3>
<p>
  To give a bit of background, I plan on travelling via bicycle from London to
  Istanbul &gt; (fly to Shanghai) &gt; Shanghai &gt; Kunming &gt; (fly to
  Calcutta) &gt; Calcutta &gt; Kochi &gt; Mumbai &gt; (fly to Bangkok) &gt;
  Bangkok &gt; Singapore &gt; (fly to Perth) &gt; Around Australia &gt; Home? I
  may go further but there aren't currently any plans. I plan on travelling as
  light as possible. My dSLR and netbook will be the heaviest and bulkiest items
  totalling around 3.5kg, but beyond those I'll be travelling with very few
  things, ideally no more than 15kg's worth including the weight of the bags,
  tools and spares.
</p>
<p>
  My netbook (Asus N280 atom with 2Gb RAM) will provide me with a platform to
  write blogs, process my SLR photos and program on. I currently have Ubuntu
  11.04 x64 installed on it, but am considering Windows 7 via dual boot. It
  typically has a 6-9 hour battery life depending upon what I'm doing so will
  last quite a while.
</p>
<h3>Developing With Limited Hardware</h3>
<p>
  Ideally I would develop in C# using Visual Studio 2010. I'm very familiar with
  ASP MVC, and have a few open source project of my own running (<a
    href="https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/automvc"
    target="_blank"
    >automvc</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robertbeal/rakeoff" target="_blank">rakeoff</a
  >).
</p>
<p>
  Given I don't think Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2010 (and ReSharper 5) will
  run very well on the netbook (although I plan to try before leaving), the
  other alternative to look at is Linux as my development platform.
</p>
<p>
  I currently know Ruby fairly well, and have played around with Rails. Both run
  without problem on my netbook. I could also brush up on my JQuery/JavaScript
  and try out HTML5 and CSS3 using Chromium. For closed source repositories I
  have a Bit Bucket account (excellent service, and I really like Mercurial) so
  can do typical commits/branching etc... This gives me plenty to play with and
  the ability to build fully functioning web applications, although does mean
  turning my back on my primary .Net skills.
</p>
<h3><strong>Making Development Easier</strong></h3>
<p>
  My netbook has a limited atom processor, and a very small screen (1024x600
  resolution) which can make development awkward. In Linux there are a few easy
  changes that can make development easier to do.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Screen Estate</strong> - given the limited amount of pixels, the
    screen area needs to be used effectively. I like Unity as a GUI but it's not
    mature enough yet for my liking. Instead I use
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/awn/" target="_blank"
      >avant-window-navigator</a
    >. I hide all the standard "gnome" panels, and instead have a 36 pixel-wide
    bar down the left hand side of my screen. It's set to hide when not focussed
    on, so that all I can see is the window I'm currently looking at.
    <em>sudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shortcuts</strong> - once everything is hidden, I need a quick way
    of navigating from window to window. This can be done easily enough using
    the standard keyboard shortcuts. Compared with Windows though, you can
    customize all of the shortcuts yourself easily, and select your preferred
    Ctrl+Alt app switcher.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      ><a href="http://do.davebsd.com/" target="_blank">Gnome Do</a></strong
    >
    - for opening up new applications Gnome-Do is a great application launcher
    allowing me to opening anything within a few key presses and without having
    to rely on the GUI. <em>sudo apt-get install gnome-do</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Guake</strong> - for terminal based work Guake is a great
    modification of the simple terminal window. It resembles the old Quake
    terminal so pops down from the top of the screen during a defined keypress.
    It also allows tabbing of terminals so you can find the window you're
    looking for much more easily. <em>sudo apt-get install guake</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Chromium </strong>- given most of my work will be web related, for a
    lot of it I use Chromium because it's lighter, and uses up less vertical
    screen space. For automated tasks, or browser compatibility though I still
    use Firefox.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      ><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank"
        >Mercurial</a
      > </strong
    >- as mentioned I use Mercurial, a) because I like it (no more than I do
    Git), but also b) because I can use BitBucket for free open source and more
    importantly, private repositories. I do all of my commands via the terminal.
    <em>sudo apt-get install hg</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Ruby &amp; Rails</h3>
<p>
  Installing Ruby is easy enough in Ubuntu. I've already written a
  <a
    title="Ruby, RubyGems, Synaptic and setting paths"
    href="http://www.robertbeal.com/968/using-ruby-via-synaptic-and-installing-gems"
    >post</a
  >
  on how to do so, and set up your gem locations. To setup Rails there are a few
  extra packages you need:
</p>
<blockquote>
  sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-ruby libsqlite3-dev libxml2
  libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev &amp;&amp;<br /><br />sudo gem install rails;
</blockquote>
<p>
  That will install all of the dependencies needed, namely for SQLite, meaning
  you're all ready to make a rails application.
</p>
<p>
  All the above should give me a good platform for doing any programming during
  my spare time in my travels. My mind is full of travel info at the moment, but
  come travelling I'll probably work on a few small applications and maybe one
  website.
