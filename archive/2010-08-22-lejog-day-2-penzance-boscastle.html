  /><strong>25th July 2010 - </strong>One of the hardest days of the whole trip.
  Mainly because it was our first full day, but also the amount of ascent, and
  also the steepness of some of the climbs. It was one of the most enjoyable
  routes though. We set off from Penzance YHA hostel after breakfast at around
  9am and were quickly on our way. It was a cloudy start but turned very sunny
  (high of around 25C). We didn't put on any sun block so got caught out and
  quite badly burnt which was a problem for a few days. The roads were generally
  very good, even the country lanes. It wasn't until around 70km that we started
  hitting really step hills. We even found a 33% hill, the steepest of the whole
  trip. Prior to it there were hills, but not the unbearably steep ones.

  The views along the coast were amazing and well worth the effort. We took
  lunch at 45km which was a little soon (less than half way). The stopping
  destination of Peranporth was a big of a let down too. A typical British
  seaside town, so a little tacky and quite busy. We had a 15min nap at lunch,
  as we were already feeling tired.

  After lunch it didn't get any easier and we ended up arriving at Boscastle YHA
  hostel at around 8pm, instead of the planned 5pm. This meant we had to rush a
  little to shower, clean down our gear, and get dinner, and then an early-ish
  night (11pm). The hostel and town was really nice though. Beautifully kept,
  it's just a shame we couldn't have got there sooner to enjoy it more. The
  hostel had plenty of bike space, I think we were the only bikes there, but it
  could have easily stored a dozen bikes. The down hills in the second part of
  the day were very steep too, and our brake pads took quite a hammering. We did
  hit speeds of our 60kph though.
