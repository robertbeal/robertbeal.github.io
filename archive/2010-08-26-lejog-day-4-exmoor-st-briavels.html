  <strong>27th July 2010 - </strong>One of our longest days that turned into a
  bit of a nightmare. It started off with some very light drizzle in Exmoor but
  eventually became a sunny day (a little worrying for the sun burn) with a high
  of around 27C. We set off quite early at around 8:30am (early in the sense the
  hostel didn't serve breakfast until 7:50am) and made our way down out of
  Exmoor. We changed the route slightly and added some more distance in favour
  of smoother, faster roads by heading north along the A396. The roads coming
  out of Exmoor were quite amazing first thing in the morning. Trees overhanging
  the road with the sunlight cutting through, we managed to hit quite high
  speeds (around 50-60kph).

  Once we got into Somerset the hills disappeared and it became very flat,
  meaning on a slight hill you could see way across the county. It was great
  cycling, and the roads we picked were smooth, flat and had barely any cars on,
  to the point we road a lot of the way side by side. We got to Ashton Court
  Estate park overlooking Bristol quite late, at around 5pm. As we left the park
  the GPS cut (it hadn't got a proper charge the night before) so I had to
  navigate from memory and using my Nokia 5800 which has GPS and maps installed
  on it.

  We went over Clifton Suspension bridge and through Bristol. It was actually
  very pleasant given it was a city. We then dropped out of Bristol and crossed
  the very windy Severn bridge (the older one). It had a cycle lane away from
  the road which was great, so crossing it was easy. On the other side we
  entered Chepstow (and hence Wales) briefly before cycling up hill to St
  Briavels. Chepstow wasn't the nicest of areas, but the road up the St Briavels
  was very picturesque, which made the last 10k very pleasurable despite having
  cycled 95 miles already.

  We got in around 9:30pm, our latest arrival on the whole trip. This didn't
  leave us much time to relax or enjoy the castle we were staying in. St
  Briavels hostel was certainly the most unique hostel we stayed in, although
  given its uniqueness the facilities were quite poor (especially the shower).
  This can be forgotten though given you're staying in a 16th century castle!
