<p>
  EXT4 is soon to become the default file system in Ubuntu once 9.10 (Karmic)
  has been released. I've already been using it, but have stumbled across a few
  problems.
</p>
<a name="more"></a>
<ol>
  <li>
    Reverting - I moved all of my backups and vast amounts of data across into
    EXT4 partitions. I have since been having a few problems with Ubuntu Server
    9.04, and had wanted to revert back to Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS but was unable
    to do so (as it's not compatible with EXT4). A bit of a problem as reverting
    Ubuntu version and file system type won't be easy, and will take time. In
    retrospect, I wish I had stayed with EXT3 for 6-12 months longer until I was
    happy it was ok to switch.
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows - I still use Windows occasionally, and it's generally handy to be
    able to access your files in Windows. Currently there is no EXT4 driver for
    Windows. From what I can remember, something like EXTFSD, will work with an
    EXT3 partition "upgraded" to EXT4. A cleanly formatted EXT4 partition is
    different though and doesn't currently work. EXT2IFS will only work with
    EXT3 (and an inode size of 128)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Apart from those issues, I've found EXT4 to be very good, and it does seem
  quicker (although it's hard to tell). It works very well for the root ("/")
  partition. For separate home and other partitions though, sticking with EXT3
  may be a better idea. I plan on reverting over the next month or so, and will
  probably stick with EXT3 until Ubuntu 10.04 or even 10.10.
</p>
<p>
  One important note, if using EXT2IFS you want an EXT3 partition with an
  "inode" size of 128. As of Ubuntu 8.10 onwards it will format EXT3 partitions
  with an inode size of 256.
</p>
<h3>Reverting to EXT3</h3>
<p>Open up a terminal. Firstly find out the partition you want to revert:</p>
<blockquote>sudo fdisk -l</blockquote>
<p>
  This will list all of the partition devices. Find the one you want, for
  example in my case /dev/sda7. Now enter:
</p>
<blockquote>sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda7 | grep Inode</blockquote>
<p>
  You'll now need to backup all of your files. I had a spare hard drive kicking
  around to move them their manually using Nautilus. Once moved, you can format
  the partition. Given that the Ubuntu 8.10 installation disc onwards will
  format an EXT3 partition with an inode size of 256, you'll need to manually do
  it yourself via command line:
</p>
<blockquote>sudo mke2fs -I 128 -j -t ext3 /dev/sda7</blockquote>
<p>
  It should only take a minute or so. If you want to you can add "-c" to the
  command, and it'll run a check on the inode table, but it takes aaaages. My
  1TB drive took over 4 hours.
</p>
<h3>Further Problems</h3>
<p>
  Under Windows XP (SP3 and earlier) both EXT2IFS and EXT2FSD will run without
  any problems. However, I'm currently running Windows 7 x64.
</p>
<p>
  EXT2IFS will run on Windows 7 x64 whereas EXT2FSD won't. This means I have to
  have an EXT3 128 inode size formatted partition. It's all currently, just
  about working perfectly. I, for some reason, can't run .exe's on my mounted
  EXT3 partition in Windows 7. It looks like a permissions issue related to the
  EXT2IFS driver. I vaguely remember fixing something similar with Vista (ages
  back) but have since forgotten. It's currently usable, but still not ideal.
  I'll post once I find a fix.

<h3>Update 23/09/2009</h3>

  I've now got
