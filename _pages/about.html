<p>
  I've worked for over 17 years in software, as contributor, strategist,
  manager and leader. I enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high quality, high value
  software from concept to customer. I'm a passionate advocate of people first, servant-led
  leadership; continuous improvement; Agile and Lean principles, code craft (...test-driven), DevOps
  practices (especially continuous deployment); and I'm overly obsessed with security, privacy, and all things open source.

  iterative, incremental, continuous delivery from concept to customer; people
  over process; transparency; empowered, happy staff; effective, hands-off
  management; simplicity
