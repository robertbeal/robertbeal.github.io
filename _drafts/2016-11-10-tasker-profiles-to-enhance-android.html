<p>I've been using Tasker for a few years now, and over that time have built up dozens of tasks, some small, some more complex, that improve the stock intelligence of my Android phone. Sadly the xml Tasker spits out isn't the easiest to move about, otherwise I'd show profiles via xml snippets. But for now I'll just detail what I use Tasker for.</p> <h3>Display Off</h3> <p>When the screen is off, disable NFC to help optimise battery</p> <ul><li>Context - Display State Off</li><li>Task - Nfc Off</li><li>Exit - (restore previous settings)</li></ul> <h3>Charging</h3> <p>While charging, I may as well turn on NFC, Wifi</p> <ul><li>Context - Power Any</li><li>Task - Wifi On; Nfc On</li><li>Exit - (restore previous settings)</li></ul> <h3>Wifi Scan</h3> <p>Rather than rely on location services, I turn Wifi on every hour. If I'm in a known location, like Home, then it'll connect. If not my Wifi Idle profile will turn it back off.</p> <ul><li>Context - Time 0700 to 0500 every 1h</li><li>Task - Wifi On</li><li>Exit - none</li></ul> <h3>Wifi Idle</h3> <p>I frequently turn my Wifi on automatically. If however it doesn't connect to a network, after 2 minutes I turn it back off. This is to help save battery.</p> <ul><li>Context - Wifi Not Connected</li><li>Task - Wait 2mins; Wifi Off if(%WIFII !~R >>> CONNECTION <<<)</li><li>Exit - (disable restore previous settings)</li></ul> <h3>Location</h3> <p>I have Location Services turned off by default. I only switch them on and GPS when opening certain apps.</p> <ul><li>Requires - Root + Secure Settings <li>Context - App; Google Maps, CityMapper, Weather Timeline</li><li>Task - GPS On; Location Services On</li><li>Exit - GPS Off; Location Services Off</li></ul> <h3>Adblock via /etc/hosts</h3> <p>Rather than use AdAway, I run my own script so that I can include custom hosts for my home network.</p> <ul><li>Requires - Root + BusyBox <li>Context - Time 0600; Wifi Connected</li><li>Task -      <ol>    <li>Run Shell (select 'use Root'):  <blockquote>echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" > /sdcard/hosts &&  /system/xbin/wget -O - https://www.dropbox.com/your.custom.hosts.file >> /sdcard/hosts &&  /system/xbin/wget -O - https://adaway.org/hosts.txt >> /sdcard/hosts &&  /system/xbin/wget -O - https://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt >> /sdcard/hosts &&  /system/xbin/wget -O - "https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext" >> /sdcard/hosts </blockquote>    </li>    <li>Remount: /system Writeable On</li>    <li>Run Shell (select 'use Root'): <blockquote>cp /sdcard/hosts /etc/hosts</blockquote>    <li>Remount: /system Writeable Off</li>    </ol></li><li>Exit - (disable restore previous settings)</li></ul>
